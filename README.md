# Sentiment Analysis Project
Training model that differentiates between positive, negative, and neutral text using Yelp reviews from open-source dataset.
# Description
This model is part of an Honors Project I took on senior year of high school to gain hands-on experience with and an introduction to Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning techniques. This project involved learning Python functionality for Data Science applications, such as Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, and nltk, and using these libraries to pre-process the dataset and train the model.
