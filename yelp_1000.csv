A group of us went to dinner there and shut the place down. They have affordable wine and sangria, and it is not loud at all, so its the perfect place for a casual dinner with friends.And the food is amazing. If youve never been you definitely need to get the chicken on your first trip. The rice and beans are so good (some restaurants just mail those traditional sides in) and they are seasoned well with saffron (rice) and whatever is in the beans I just want to drink up. The ripe plantains and tostones are excellent as well. And the chicken is deliciously roasted and the skin is nice and crispy. The side sauces they bring To the table with your meal are the perfect accompniant: ones has a slow burn spiciness and the other is mild for those who dont like spicy (as a tip, they make great dipping sauces for your plantains and tostones).On my most recent visit we went for lunch, so unfortunately no wine or sangria was involved. I ordered the salad for a bit lighter option, with a side of tostones (obvi). The salad was fresh and delicious and I basically hit the avocado jackpot (I think there was a whole sliced avocado on my salad). My salad was made complete with a generous helping of shredded chicken on top. The tostones were crispy and satisfying.I would not go her all the time because I would probably order chicken in some variety, but when I have a craving for well made chicken and rice, this is my spot.",17qZxRhTcp_JSnEg65COkA,3,0.9508516192436218

I ordered the 1/4 chicken white meat meal with rice, beans, and plantains. My husband got the 1/4 dark with yucca. Everything was great! The chicken was super flavorful, even bites without skin tasted like the marinade/seasonings they use. The rice, as many other reviewers have mentioned, is delicious - the saffron flavor is definitely noticeable, but not overpowering (I love saffron, so I was not surprised that the rice was one of my favorite parts of the meal -  a close second to the chicken.)

Tried to place a pickup order, which had a few hiccups in itself. When we went to pick up, we got a very weird cold vibe, with the employees we dealt with not making eye contact or saying more than 2 words to us. After waiting a little too long to get our order that was already sitting on the counter, the guy opens each box and verbally confirms what we ordered. Getting home, one entire half of our order was actually just a big salad that we did not order...he definitely saw this. We called back and said we are coming back to get our chicken, will it be ready when we get there? Yes of course. Arrive back at Pio Pio and, just kidding, they are out of chicken (yeah right). Obviously angry at this point and asking for a refund, they said they didnt run the card so theres no need, when we earlier watched them run it and signed for it. We asked for some kind of proof of this, and they could provide none. Whether the charge shows up or not, we believe that they saw that the order was wrong, didnt feel like re-making anything at closing time, and sent us home knowing that. Why they told us to come back to the restaurant only to turn us away 5 minutes later I dont know.

I immediately went to check it out and thank goodness I did! Their rotisserie chicken is ALWAYS tender and juicy and cooked just right and the skin is perfectly seasoned with just the right amount of crunch. Then there is their sauces..mmmm. Right away they serve these two sauces (one green, one white) and I have no clue what they are but you want to drench everything you get with them. The white one is delicious on their salads, which added bonus: comes with some sliced avocado on top for a nice little touch. The restaurant is fairly small and can pack up pretty quickly. Also, once something must have happened because the entire place was filled with smoke and now I have a friend who will only eat outside.

I was feeling a bit homesick and this place took me right back to Miami with the music, food, and beverage selection. Unfortunately they don't offer Malta Hatuey or Jupi'xc3'xb1a on their drink menu but then again those ARE Cuban drinks and their menu is Colmbian/Peruvian for the most part.

Adding fresh avacado to a salad is delicious...This isnt a Peruvian joint. Lomo Saltado is a Peruvian dish. What we had was Lomo by name, but not taste. DISAPPOINTING. Whats more, there was a vinegar after taste. If youre a Lomo lover, skip this dish!The rotisserie chicken was tender and tasty. Nevertheless, its similar to Costco rotisserie not a traditional Peruvian rotisserie with the expected spices. I do question if they just buy Costco rotisserie chickens and resell them.  The rice was moist, but the added food coloring strange. The beans needed work, spice, something... less of a just dropped this out of a can taste. Finally, its extremely tacky to see handwritten signs for up charges on sauces for a sit down restaurant.  DC has a plethora of authentic Peruvian spots.

The chicken empanadas are pretty darn good, crispy on the outside but have a great flavor on the inside and arent greasy at all. The tostones and plantains are pretty decent, but the yucca is a bit stringy sometimes and can disappoint. The salad is spot on, nice avocado and the white sauce compliments it well. The green sauce is one of my favorites but is really inconsistent, some days its tolerable hot and some days its going to burn your face off but I enjoy that.

We also ordered a side of the saffron rice and plantains ($16.50 total). The chicken was served with 2 sauces- a green sauce that tasted like spicy basil and a white sauce that has a hint of horseradish. Both were excellent with the chicken and the rice. Oh and did I mention the rice? The side ($3.50) came with 2 giant helpings! We had so much food on our table. It was a Peruvian Thanksgiving! However, the plantains were the real winner of the night. They were cooked to perfection. Soft on the inside and crispy on the out. Mix a little green sauce on top of them and you have the perfect combination of sweet and spicy!I knocked off a star from my review because the service was really odd.

My friend doesnt like bones! So we had a few other dishes and shared a lot. The service was attentive, prompt, and friendly. The atmosphere is basic. On to the food reviews:* Green and white table sauces: The green has a nice kick to it. The white is somewhat tangier. You could mix them together or enjoy them each separately. Theyre darn good, but I wouldnt say you would drink them by the ounce (i.e. they seemed to be slightly overhyped based on what I was told by my friend).* Arepa: 3.5 stars. Pretty standard, average stuff. No seared flavor, it is merely a vessel.* Tostones: 3.5 stars. Same as above. They lose heat quickly and end up a bit hard.* Sweet plantains: 5 stars. They have a delicious sugary burnt crisp to the edge, unlike most places where they end up mushy. Definitely order this as one of your sides.* Rice: 4 stars. Its rice. Its nice rice.* Pork skin: 4+ stars. Nothing outstanding, but its done right. Maybe a little on the smallish side. Pork skins are always at least 4 stars when done right.* Chicken soup: 4.5 stars. You may want to add salt, but be sure not to overwhelm the subtle spices that lend the broth an extraordinary flavor. I did find it slightly bland, but Im not deducting any stars for a restaurant that chooses to let you salt to taste instead of deciding how much sodium you need.* Side salad: *shrug* Its a salad. Its got decent size to it, but it is what it is.Good stuff, and a change from the usual.

The food, the prices and the service were all excellent.Having lived in South Florida for over 20 years before moving to North Carolina, I miss the great Latin food you can get in Miami and many other nooks and crannys in that area. Charlotte has its own treasure trove of ethnic restaurants, you just have to know where to find them and boy is Pio Pio a find. Theyre most known for their rotisserie chicken, but their steak and chicharones are even better, in my opinion. But, the real killer app at Pio Pio is their sauce. Sauces, I should say. The white sauce is a garlic sauce that is so full of flavor I could eat it on just about anything and it works great as salad dressing. The green sauce is spicy and is awesome combined with the white sauce. It tastes like a tomatillo sauce with a serious kick. To steal Emerils line, these sauces would taste good on a car bumper.If youre not sure what to try, get the Montanero platter. For just under 15 bucks you get rice, beans, ripe plantains, steak, egg, pork, skin (i.e. chicharones, and really good ones at that), sausage, avocado & corn cake. The corn cake (areppa) is very bland, but thats not unusual. Everything else is delicious and its definitely enough for two. Ive split it with my mom before and still had leftovers to take home. I also highly recommend the tostones (crispy fried plantains).I travel about a half hour to get to Pio Pio and every time its worth the drive.

How am I suppose to know how much sauce I need?? My family loves condiments ... how many extras will I need for everyone. I decided on an extra 2 of each sauce. Adding another dollar to my bill. Overall I was satisfied with what I ordered. The food was tasty and the portions were good.

I order dinner from Pio Pio once a week, typically on Sundays and usually get takeout. After placing an order it is typically ready within 10-20 minutes of the call. The food is absolutely amazing and the price point is unbeatable. My usual order is a whole rotisserie chicken, large rice and large beans. This order comes with two white sauce and two green sauce. I prefer the white sauce over the green sauce as the green sauce is very spicy. They have a small patio for outside dining and when I have eaten at the restaurant the service has always been great!

I got the arroz con pollo (rice with chicken) and my boyfriend got 1/4 chicken with rice and beans. We also had the ripe plantains which were amazing. They give you a lot of food and we were stuffed afterwards! Now to the negatives...having gone to Viva Chicken before Pio Pio is more expensive with not toooooo much of a difference, so I cant justify spending more on something that tastes just as good with the same amount of food. Plus Viva Chicken gives you UNLIMITED FREE sauce! I did not like having to pay .25 extra for every sauce. Its not a big deal, but if you like sauce like me then it is a game changer to pay more for the food as well as pay more for additional sauces.

The last few times we were there we noticed the quality and portions had gone significantly down hill.  Its probably been a few years since we were back but decided to give it another chance with a Groupon. Safe to say we will stick with Viva Chicken here on out. I dont know where Pio Pio is getting their chickens from these days but they are more like Cornish Hens with very little meat on them. The black beans came in a tiny bowl with mostly broth and maybe 2 spoons of actual beans.  The rice was good. They used to have several different kinds of sauces- not anymore.  Its just ok but given that viva chicken is 10x better why would I go back to subpar Pio Pio- disappointing because at one time this place was great.,0G40sfRx04rxUMWURAJY4A,1,0.1879177689552307

The exterior is actually pretty cool looking.  There is an old VW bug on the roof, a triceratops statue outside, and the building looks like an old garage converted to a restaurant.  Inside has some interesting decor, seems they're trying to be a little unique and they are.Parking... wow.  There are about 6 parking spots, don't even bother pulling in.

Is that even possible? For sound to taste?  Anyways you know what I mean.  Ding Dong Chicken:  Grilled chicken breast, crunchy peanut butter, cole slaw.  Just didn't do my palette justice.

Thats what the description says, what they lack is actual crab meat.  They were big deep fried hush puppy balls, I tore every one up and had others try them.  No taste of crab what so ever nor site of any meat.  Pourina tried them too and his elite taste buds could not sense any crab either.Needless to say, sounds like growing pains.

It was sub par to say the least!   Before even getting to the ultimate fail of the peanut butter, the chicken pattie and cafeteria-like white bun really deflated any chance of this being worth it's cost.  Both were clearly mass produced, frozen, thawed, warmed and slopped on a plate after being cooked in an admittedly decent array of spices.  The only reason I ordered this particular sando was to partake on a thai like peanut/spice journey and to take my first bite and arrive with a thick schtick of crunchy Jif on the roof of my mouth couldn't have pissed me off more.  This sandwich seriously had potential, but it's like someone gave up along the way and settled for this will do.That being said, I'm willing to give the joint another shot for two reasons:1.  The white bean hummus was tasty.2.  They were giving away free beer in lieu of not having secured their ABC permit.I sincerely hope this place makes it b/c it's great for the neighborhood, but I feel there are some menu offerings that need to step it up a notch.",23-B3QtVnMUbgp7QGeCwyg,1,0.8896501064300537

I live across the street, but Pinky's is not the neighborhood locale. I love the decor, appreciate how they restored the original building, love the ambiance, hip crowd, pin up, rockabilly style that the employees rock but that's about as far as it goes. Good beer selection with great prices don't get me wrong, but as far as food, just your average run of the mill bar. The best item I had was the pimp pimento fries. The chicken wings were nothing special, a little soggy actually. While they were very meaty, they weren't the least bit crispy. The fish tacos were even worse, a little too fishy tasting. In a nutshell, Pinky's is a really cool spot to hang out at though. A good place to grab a drink, but not necessarily a prime spot to grab some grub. I guess that might be why it's classified as a diner on Yelp. Definitely worth checking out though.

Having followed all the drama in the paper about what this place to become and how it almost became the new Penguin, I figured it was time for a taste test of my own.First of all, the parking is an afterthought that should have been a first thought as the location is not neighborhood friendly.  The corner of Freedom and Morehead is not exactly the place you want to be darting across the street.  With only 6 real parking spots in front of Pinky's, the logistics of parking is something to keep in mind.  I found parking in a grassy lot off Morehead, just past the restaurant.  This space seemed like a go to for others as well.  I have no idea if this is 'legal' parking space, but my car was still there when I got back and there were no nasty-grams on the windshield, so...Moving on to the actual space, I quite liked the interior decor.  It was a mix between a bar, a man-cave and a tiki hut, all stuffed into a garage-type space with a juke box thrown in for good measure.  Where you sit will actually determine which theme you get.  My favorite were the two-seater booths adjacent to the bar, small and compact, but just enough space for a cozy lunch with non-stranger.I was glad to see a hostess station at the front door, something needed at more of the popular dives in town.  We were seated right away, being only a party of two.  I'd be leary of going here with a much larger party, not only did they have to wait, but pushing tables together here would be a little like one of those puzzle mazes- move the pieces around until the picture is formed.Service is attentive but very casual, most of the servers wear their body and facial piercings proudly along with their black t-shrts with Pinky's logo.  Just part of the local color as far as I am concerned.  I am very glad to see servers use the team approach- as in the person who took your drink order may not take your food order and also may not be the person who brings the food to the table.  This always makes me feel very taken care of and ensures drinks are refilled and food is served as soon as it comes from the kitchen.The menu is broken down into sections- apps, salads, burgers, dogs, and other sandwiches.  There is no consistent theme to the menu- from fresh falafel to a thai-style melange of toppings for your burger or dog.  This is not to say it's bad, just know that the options are plentiful and different.  I had the Falafel wrap and it was a little wimpy for me.  Falafel patties were a bit too mushy and the wrap was too big for the contents of the sandwich.  Slathering in too much tahini sauce did not help fill the void either- it just overpowered the other tastes.  I did not finish mine.  Now my wife had a burger and it was quite good.  Cooked nicely and the bun was a perfect mix of soft and chewy without being a total mess.  Did not try the Ding-Dong style , so I have no comments for this.  Something about peanut butter on a beef burger just didn't do it for me.  Sandwiches do not come with a side- you need to order separately.  Waffle fries were nice and crispy.  Note that a single order is enough for two to share- and they should be at a price of about $4.  Another tempting option was sweet potato fries- they will have to wait for another trip.Do not skip appetizers, though.  Seriously good friend pickles with a proper ranch sauce should be a must for most.  Thin-sliced pickle chips in a crispy friend batter, they way the should be.  No pickle spears, no wimpy breading.  This is a highlight for Pinky's.  I might just agree with others: these are an improvement over The Penguin's version (sacrilege, I know).  The bar has quite the selection of beers, including PBR tall boys.  Many micro draft selections abound too.  Had it not been a business day lunch, I'd have definitely had a beer with the pickles.  However, I do give Pinky's props for serving the huge glasses of tea or soda.  No frequent refills needed.So yeah, there are some issues here.  But I also found quite a bit to like.  Now as you might can piece together from our meal selections, this is not a place to be calorie-conscious- though you might could make it work with their salad selections (but then you'd miss all the really good stuff).  But sometimes you just have to follow the flavor, and Pinky's definitely has the start of something good there.",AwyM03qzhwgyskBruurWQw,3,0.8808754682540894

They have a large selection of more healthy eats for those who don't want a burger and waffle fries. Lots of great salads.

But Pinky's stands up to the comparison and... dare I say it... may even be better.Penguin regulars will see many old friends on Pinky's menu, which includes fried pickles and Pinky's Westside, aka a small block southern style. Tastewise, they hold their own. But Pinky's is striking out on its own, too. There are waffle fries on the menu, which are always welcome, and there are even--GASP!--some healthy options. The kinda fried turkey sandwich is delicious, with flavorful, perfectly poached turkey and bacon. The Nature Boy, Pinky's version of a veggie burger, is clearly housemade, a nice alternative to the Boca burger afterthoughts most restaurants throw at the vegetarians in the room. There's something for everyone on the menu without feeling like they threw everything on there.I'll always have a soft spot for the Penguin, but with more options, air conditioning and *almost* enough room for the hungry customers, I think it's safe to say Pinky's will do just fine on its own.",uIu2oifqdP1VJe7bYLJ6ug,5,0.9681344032287598

The awesome color-changing specials board behind the bar is fun to look at, and my friend and I were seated immediately at the bar in the middle of the afternoon, past people who were also there in 2s but who apparently had something against immediate gratification.  Oh well, all the better for us!  Since I love anything with crab in it, we ordered the crab hush puppies.  They came piping hot, with tasty, tangy remoulade sauce accompanying.  After my friend and I had each tried one, our food came immediately...pretty much turning them into another side.  The waitress did apologize, saying that sometimes they came out early and sometimes it all came out at the same time.  Well, ok.  Thats not really how the appetizer/entree system works, but theyre in early days and CRAB HUSH PUPPIES HOW COULD I EVER BE MAD???  They were delicious, decadent and rich.  I also had the embarrassingly named Da Pimp sandwich, which was my first ever time eating pimento cheese (Im a terrible southerner, sorry guys!) and it was alright.  I guess Im just not crazy about pimento cheese.  But, but, but, BUT!  As my side I ordered the beer battered fried squash, and, you guys.  They were.  So good.  Not totally smothered in batter, just a light, yet crispy coating, which allowed the squash flavor to shine along with the delicious crispiness.  It was only my first visit but Ill definitely be back.  I have to see how the burgers are and of course the fried pickles.  As far as the whole this vs. the Penguin thing, I intentionally didnt order anything that was the same from both menus, and what I had was delish.  So I suggest going there with no preconceived notions in your head and just enjoy good food and good beer.(p.s. park across the street by the head shop...it is decidedly very penguin-esque in its parking situation...)",dfYRsyixtlseDnFWpmCGYQ,1,0.8660138845443726

The only reason it gets 2 stars is the fried pickles. Those fried pickles just have a way of making things better. I had the chicken tenders and my mom had a hamburger (I guess I shouldve been a little more creative, but I thought it would be difficult to mess up chicken tenders...guess not). Her hamburger came with nothing but well...a greasy hamburger in a basket. My chicken tenders were a bit burned, but the fries were great. We had 3 different waitresses checking up on us, but getting the check took a long time. A group came in (we went on a Monday afternoon...a teacher workday) and wanted to be seated, and getting enough tables together took about 10 minutes and space was very crammed.

We went on a weekend night, and they had great pitcher specials and very friendly service for our somewhat large group.

My husband and I got our burgers and as I went to take my first bite noticed a huge nasty hair on my burger... GROSS!! our never present waitress couldn't be found (again) so the bartender saw me looking for someone and screamed across the bar @ me what's up? not wanting to scream back the problem she finally came over and saw why i wasn't happy. She said she would get me another burger immediately and left. so as i sit i go to snack on our fries... and they were hard as bricks... not crispy or slightly done my oil soaked old fries. gross again. by this time i was pretty ticked but still being nice. 20 minutes later another server flings a burger on the table at me and walks away... except it wasn't what i ordered!!! my husband said his burger was pretty dry and not that great too. by the time someone comes by again i tell them its not what i wanted, the girl picks up my burger goes to the bartender and they ensue on arguing about how i didn't know what I was talking about and what i did/ did not order in front of the whole bar, why they just didn't check the ticket was beyond me.  i ordered a simple burger!  By the time the girl came back over i told her to forget about it and we just wanted our check. she took off the hush puppies because of everything (which i totally appreciated) and boxed up the replacement burger and we left asap.

My order: Fried pickles and the Kinda Fried Turkey sandwich (herb coated turkey breast on a big bun, topped with melted provolone, bacon, basil, tomato & garlic-parmesan spread). Highly recommend the kinda fried turkey sammy. Pinky's deep-fries a full turkey that is completely herb coated then slices the turkey for the sandwiches. The turkey was moist, falls apart in your mouth and is extremely flavorful (probably the best tasting turkey I've ever had). The garlic parmesan spread was a perfect compliment to the turkey. The sandwich was so delicious that when I go back, I will definitely want to order this sandwich again due to fear that I might be semi-disappointed with a different dish (which I'm sure is unlikely). In regards to the fried pickles, they were also delightful - but I've noticed it's nearly impossible to screw up fried pickles. Also, they have diet cheerwine on tap. Doesn't get much better than that. My bf had the Big John (6 oz chicken breast, fried or grilled topped with swiss cheese, bacon, honey mustard, lettuce & tomato on a seeded bun) with the vegetarian chili. He really enjoyed his meal as well - unfortunately, I can't comment any further as I didn't taste test them myself. Our server was attentive but not overbearing and the prices are affordable.

I cant say enough about the service. Out waitress was really laid back but attentive and personable.Ill give 4/5 because of the pricing. Although I wouldnt call this place expensive by any sense of the word the pricing did seem a bit off.

I do not even want to imagine what this place is like when they are busy.  Is it too much to ask that places get ample parking rather than having to look for it elsewhere?Once inside, the surroundings are nice.  For those looking to find the cramped-yet-homey feel of the old Penguin, look elsewhere.  This is more of a redone, upscale garage.  It works.

Friendly enough, just not all that motivated if you know what I mean.When it comes to the food is when things really shine.  In fact, the menu is so awesome that the actual food has trouble keeping up.

A couple of muted monitors over the bar ran ESPN2 and some sports equipment infomercials.Sitting down, we noticed the menu is varied enough to satisfy anyone. The beer list is great, the mixed drink list is intriguing, and Id love to come here with a group of adults in search of a good time. The smiling, artfully tattooed and nose-ringed waitress brought me a fresh cup of really fine coffee. My son had a Dr. Browns Root Beer. We shared a small order of fried dill pickles before our sandwiches arrived. They were piping hot, lightly breaded, and served with a cool ranch dip. I ate so many I had a stomach ache later. They were better than I remembered them from the old Penguin.I had the Ding Dong Chicken Sandwich, a Thai-inspired concoction of grilled chicken, peanuts, lettuce, tomato, mayo, Sriracha, and other goodies on a sandwich bun. It was hot, tasty, and satisfying. J. had a Kinda Fried Turkey Sandwich. He was stuffed and happy, having washed it down with his root beer.The restaurant is a remodeled service station that was obviously around for a long, long, time, but it has been tastefully rebuilt, attractively furnished, and turned into a really cool, if small bar/restaurant.

While the experience was good, it unfortunately didnt merit the enthusiasm I felt going in. What I liked: - Prices. The majority of the entrees are at a $7-9 range and they are generous with portion sizes.- Atmosphere. It is laid back and comfortable. They play rock music in the background and the vibe is completely unpretentious. - Indoor & Outdoor seating is available. If my friend didnt have such bad allergies I wouldve asked for a patio table. What I didnt like: - The waitress was very unknowledgeable about veganism. I mean they are one of the few Charlotte restaurants that actually offer a decent vegetarian and vegan selection so for her not to answer basic vegan questions on the food was a bit poor reflection on the restaurant. - The quality of the food was mediocre. I asked for the white bean & rosemary hummus for an appetizer and it was just alright. My entree was the nature boy burger and it was on the bland side. It could be salvaged with different condiments though, it just lacked some kick. - They messed up on a bill for two. We asked for the check to be split and specified twice to our waitress on who to bill what. She came back in minutes and gave us incorrect checks. Fortunately a manager was close by and fixed it for us very quickly. Overall, I would go back here and give it another try. My friend had the falafel wrap sandwich and said it was really good. He also liked his basked of waffle fries. From the looks of his wrap, it did look pretty tasty.

They also fought to keep the Volkswagen Beetle on top of their building, which was formerly home to Triple G Automotive, as the remaining sign in the parking lot attests.Choices from the menu are served up primarily by heavily inked, friendly, but way cooler than you staff. Selections from the jukebox, some of them local bands, accompany the consumption of Pimento Cheese Waffle Fries, daily specials and desserts like Cheerwine Pound Cake and specialty drinks. Framed photos of the Four Horsemen, one of whom is The Nature Boy himself (Woooo!), and NASCAR memorabilia watch over it all, reminding diners to remember their Charlotte roots.Additional parking for Pinky's is located across the street from the location at 1600 West Morehead Street in Charlotte.

Luckily, we got there before the crowd, got one of the eight parking spaces in front, and were seated immediately.  The decor inside is playful and fun.  It's a very casual place, but not in a bad way.  We were a little confused by the service because we had no less than five servers visit our table, but I guess everyone just pitches in with every table and shares the tips at the end of the night?  You've gotta really like your co-workers for that, otherwise there's bound to be some hostility if someone's not pulling their weight.Pinky's has a large drink menu (with great regular prices), as well as more non-alcoholic choices that restaurants typically offer.  The prices are also excellent on their food menu.  Items are a la carte, but they're so affordable that you don't feel ripped off ordering them that way.  We split the Pimp Fries (pimento cheese melted over waffle fries) appetizer (big enough for two) for $5.95 and then each ordered a sandwich for an additional $5.  The appetizer was AMAZING.  I probably could have used more cheese, though, for the naked fries at the bottom of the pile.  I ordered the Green Chile Pork sandwich.  Having been to Santa Fe recently, I was imagining those types of spicy flavors, since Green Chile is a big thing there.  The sandwich ended up being more Hawaiian to me, though, with the pineapple on top and other sweet flavors.  No spiciness here.  It still tasted delicious, though, and was just the right size.  Everyone was super-friendly and we enjoyed the meal.  The only problem was that because everyone just pitches in, it's kind of like the left hand not knowing what the right is doing.  It took awhile for us to get our fries appetizer and then when one of the servers picked up the empty basket, she asked, Are you waiting on anything else?  Uh yeah...our actual meal.  We waited quite awhile longer (and three drink refills) before our sandwiches were finally prepared and brought to us.  Then awhile after that for our check.  Luckily, we were still able to make our movie showtime, having budgeted some additional time.  All in all, we had a great time, and would return.

Pinky's has a trademark volkswagon on it's roof (lookin' sharp with a new paint job) and I am really happy to see that they kept the original volkswagon service sign out front.  Other outdoor items to note are the large garage doors that can be opened during good weather... makes for a really cool eating place and indoor/outdoor space.

Since we use to make the trek to the penguin, one would expect a few changes and breaking in period before the same level of quality would be reached here at Pinky's......well, let me tell you, the food is good!My secret to having takeout is to place the order between 11:00 - 11:20am , that way you are one of the first ones to be in the restaurant when the other folks are just getting ready to head to lunch.  No lines, no looking for parking spaces, but let me assure you, eating at that early time slot takes some getting use to unless you are still in high school where lunch starts around 10:45am.So I had the mammoth burger, 2-5 oz patties, with provolone cheese and bacon.  My Grease-O-Meter was running hot, and there is just nothing like having a big huge piece of hot meat in your mouth with a little cheese and bacon, oozing out of the corner of your mouth......OMG that sounded kinda gross when you read that didn't it.  (SORRY) we are talking about the burger!My co-worker had the buffalo bites, I stole one from his plate while I was bringing the food back to work, and I must say that was delicious! Ssshhh don't say anything, but I had to ask him how they were, so he offered (another) chicken bite so that I may taste it. Just like the first one, it was excellent! I would consider the buffalo chicken bites next time as it did come with fries, unlike the burgers.  I give these guys a fighting chance.....after all you have to be tough to have a name like Pinky's on the West Side of Charlotte.Overall, this location has greatly improved.

San Diego doesn't have fried pickles and other greasy yummy morsels. So I ordered the hush puppies, pimento cheese burger, regular coleslaw and fries... yes it was a major pig out... but I knew I'd have left overs to share later. I really, really enjoyed that first meal...I mean really. I also had a beer and it all only come to $17 and then plus tip.

Upon moving to the Charlotte area for the summer, my roommates and I set out to find a one-of-a-kind restaurant in the area to try out. After doing a little searching online, we settled on Pinky's and headed over to try it out.Before I delve any deeper into this review, I have a bone to pick. There are those of you who claim that the food here is too fried or leaves you feeling sick after. This is not a healthy restaurant. You don't come to Pinky's to get a little foo-foo salad with your foo-foo strawberry balsalmic dressing and a side of foo-foo fruit. And Pinky's doesn't try to sell themselves as that kind of restaurant. With that being said, here we go.Pinky's is terrific. You would be hard pressed to find a restaurant in Charlotte that has the kind of character and atmosphere as Pinky's. My favorite time to visit is later in the night during the summer, when it's cool enough to sit outside. It's the perfect place to sit down and enjoy a few beers and laughs with friends.Every time I come, we always start out with an order of the pimento cheese fries to share. Yes, you heard me correctly. These are greasy, pipin' hot french fries smothered in that scrumptious pimento cheese Southerners die for. Now, I have some health conscious friends, but let me tell you that everytime we order these, it's a full-out brawl as people fight to get the last few bites. These are a must-try appetizer, and if you're feeling extra ambitious, you can add bacon and chilli. After gorging myself with the pimento fries, I ordered the White Trash Burger. Loaded with fried pickles, onion rings, and provolone cheese, and topped off with spicy ranch, this burger isn't for the faint of heart. Just a warning...your waiter might try to persuade you into adding another patty to your burger. One patty is MORE than enough, and unless you want to induce a heart attack on  your drive home, I would advise you to steer clear of this. My roommate ordered the Tahini Salad, which far exceeded her expectations. Who knew Pinky's could also make a mean falafel? The other roommate ordered a corndog and stated that it was the best corndog she's ever had. The servers here are great; always making sure that your glass is filled up, and never hesitate to offer their recommendations on what to get. Prices are great, and portion sizes are huge.Pinky's is definitely worth a visit at least once during your time in Charlotte, and I think you'll find you'll be happy you came...although I'm not sure your scale will be as appreciative.",MHJ4fyx4HnyOaIeVKzJRug,1,0.83724045753479

It wasnt anything special, just felt like another burger to me, plus the meat was a little on the dry side which was a little bit offputting to me, but it was a decent burger.I want to give Pinkys 4 stars for the atmosphere and great service, but the food wasnt super amazing to me, Id be willing to go back to Pinkys to try other items on the menu though.

Started out with veggie chili. It was ok, but nothing special. Split the falafel balls and the friend pickles with a coworker. The falafel balls seemed pretty flavorless to me and in contrast, the fried pickles were way too salty. (and this is coming from a girl who drinks pickle juice, so that tells you how salty they were) I had a very unmemorable veggie sandwich on pita bread. I may be spoiled because where I live, fresh pita is served just about everywhere, but their pita tasted like the wonder bread of pita. My coworker had the fish tacos.

Thankfully, we noticed a sign that pointed to a lot across the street for Pinky's patrons.  Once we got in, it was slammed; however, duly noted is its small size, so slammed is relative.

I was very happy when Pinkys moved in. Previous rave reviews by others aside, I am not totally wowed by this restaurant. They do some things right, and to be fair, I have not tried everything on the menu. My wife and I started with the crab puppies. They were pretty good. I am an avowed hush puppy lover and these were good. Think the inside breading part of those cheap deviled crabs rolled into a ball and deep fried. The dipping sauce was good too with a slightly spicy, old bay kind of hint to it. The waffle fries were not great. I felt like they had been sitting around for a little while. They were warm, but not piping hot, and a little tough, but not greasy in the least but not crispy either. The regular burger, westside style ( Mustard, chili, slaw, & onions) was OK. the toppings and the bun were great but the patty just so-so. a tad dry without a lot of flavor, nobody comes here to lose weight, so maybe more fat in the mix would up the flavor quotient. . I know that the Great state of NC handicaps restaurants by dictating that they cook burgers well done, so I will not put all the blame on Pinky. My wife had the same criticism for the white trash burger. toppings were slightly better than the patty and the spicy sauce was the only thing that gave it any interest, the rest was just flavorless texture. The one brightly shining star from this visit was the Viking Corn Dog. Even a Harding Ram like myself cant help loving this masterpiece. Piping hot. crisp and golden brown, the dog was high quality and salty and savory, while the coating was slightly sweet, and the perfect thickness to compliment the dog. We loved the atmosphere, service was very good,  and parking was not a problem, but we were there at 2:30 on a Sunday afternoon during the Panthers game, I understand they can get pretty crowded at other times.

This is a fun and casual bar and grill that occupies the former space of a Volkswagen garage on the corner of Freedom and Morehead.  The old Triple 'G' Automotive sign remains outside and the owners left an old school VW Beetle on the roof of the building.  The Beetle has been painted over with a design of the American flag.Pinky's serves bar food (hamburgers, hot dogs, salads, sandwiches, etc.) with a creative flair.  For example, you can order a burger Ding Dong Style with crunchy peanut butter, honey-cilantro slaw, and spicy Sriracha sauce.  They've also got Crab Puppies (like hush puppies, except made out of crab) and a falafel wrap, so there's some variety.  Prices are very reasonable here with most entrees under $8 each.I tried one of Pinky's most popular burgers, the White Trash Burger ($4.50).  It comes with a 5 oz. patty topped with provolone cheese, fried pickles, onion rings, and spicy ranch.  While the burger is not ginormous, it is pretty satisfying.  I noticed the server didn't ask me how I'd like my burger cooked, just like my experience at Kickstand earlier this year.  I guess it's a Charlotte thing.  Regardless, the beef is good.  The bun is flat and small.The waffle fries, onion rings, and sweet potato fries are Pinky's most popular sides.  I tried an order of their onion rings plus an order of their honey-cilantro slaw.  The rings and slaw are served in BBQ take-out-style paper trays.  The onion rings are long and stringy.  The batter is a little inconsistent throughout (both crisp and soggy).  When you get to the end of the tray, it's mostly large crumbs of batter.The honey-cilantro slaw is very good.  While there isn't as much cilantro as I like (I *love* cilantro), the slaw is fresh and crisp.  The lettuce, onion, etc. are cut shredded into several long strands and the honey-mayo (or whatever sauce they use) is applied in just the right amount so the side isn't too strong.  I'd like to try this with a hot dog next time.While I haven't had them, my friends really like the crab puppies, falafel wrap, and Stray Dog (vegetarian hot dog), so those are other dishes that have a seal of approval.Inside the restaurant, many tall windows give you a nice view of the Uptown skyline.  The decor is an entertaining mishmash of all sorts of things including a Ms. Pac-Man arcade cabinet.The servers are cool, the food comes out fast, and service is great.  When the check comes, they have no problems separating the bill between couples and singles.There is limited parking available in front of the restaurant.

As a result, some of the menu is a carryover from the beloved Penguin while other items are net new (especially the salads!). For example, the out-of-this-world friend pickles are here, as are the tasty burgers. However, what sets Pinkys apart are the new food options - the funky burger combos, the excellent hot dogs, and the cool vegan options (Falafel and Veggie Chili). On this visit I had a double Ding Dong burger - two 5 oz patties topped with chunky peanut butter, cole slaw and Sriracha sauce. Yes, it sounds like a weird combo, but is exceptionally tasty (think Pad Thai sauce on a burger). My buddy had the Southern Chicken sandwich and gave it a thumbs up.

I wasn't thrilled with the bologna sandwich, but I ate it anyway. The roll was a little too soft, which made things very sloppy - although that was probably to be part of the experience. The bologna didn't have much taste; I think I was expecting something more like Taylor ham. But it was prepared well, because my Southern cousins approved when I let them try it.

The felafel was tasteless and overcooked, the fries were soft and greasy, and the hushpuppies were just ok.  Nothing to brag about, but certainly the better order. My lunch order was a Pterodactyl burger with everything.  Not a bad price, but having to pay extra for a side of fries made the price misleading.  I opted to share fries with someone else.  The burger was greasy, literally dripping with grease, and completely covered in mayonnaise.  I scraped the majority of the mayo off, but after that I couldnt get over the amount of grease.  I also had a few fried pickles, but at glancing the bottom of the container which was holding a standing level of grease, I was disgusted.  Of all the fried items, we reached a consensus that either the oil is old or was not hot enough.  Everything was soaked in oil and overcooked.I can appreciate a good burger joint, but this was beyond terrible.  Its possible to have fried food that doesnt drip with oil.

Thats a 3 patty burger with crunchy peanut butter, honey-cilantro slaw and hot sriracha sauce. It sounded amazing, but theres a snag, they only cook the burger patties to a particular doneness. OVERdone. The dry burger patties overpowered the toppings on the burger that originally made it sound so appealing in the first place. I decided to remove a patty to see if I had less meat, would the other flavors come thru? Nope. Maybe one patty. Not much better.I did have a bite of the bun and found the combination of runchy peanut butter, honey-cilantro slaw and hot sriracha sauce to be a great idea. Its too bad the overcooked meat was the most dominant flavor.

Which meant giving up restaurants for a while. Then, in December, after moving into the neighborhood I tried Pinky's again in the hope they could accommodate me. Andy, one of the owners, came and talked to me about the menu and helped me pick out a meal I could safely eat, which essentially meant custom creating a salad and salad dressing for me. They were happy to do it, took extra precautions in the kitchen, have remained helpful and cautious about my meals since. Finding a restaurant, especially of the diner variety, willing to accommodate like this is always a treat - especially when it's just down the street.If you have allergies, be prepared (as always when eating out) to have a chat with the owner/manager on duty, the servers sometimes say I'm not sure we can do this. They can - just be patient and ask. It's worth it for tasty yums! I take all my out of town friends and family here, in part so I don't have to cook dinner one night, and partly to get everyone to try fried pickles (how I miss thee!) and to get the brave to try a sandwich Ding-Dong style.

I can honestly tell you, I loved it as soon as I saw it. There is an old VW Beetle parked, on the roof. Naturally, and a concrete Triceratops waiting to greet you as you park. I gave it cool points as soon as we got parked and I could see all the small little rubber dinosaurs standing on or under Mr.Concrete Dino in the grass. Yeah I'm like a short big kid, so what???

This neighborhood is undergoing a pretty significant awakening and I'm excited to try some of the other newbies in the neighborhood also.Pinky's serves a good burger and offers several eclectic twists, both on their burgers and other menu items that make it stand out as a causal dining joint. In addition to the tasty beef burgers, Pinky's serves hot dogs, falafel, veggie/turkey burgers and various baskets, salads and sandwiches as well. I look forward to returning to try the corn dog shrimp, the falafel and the kinda fried turkey sandwich.We all tried the basic burger (the Pterodactyl), which is only available one temperature (per NC law a burger cannot be prepared rare anyway). At $3.75 (without a side but including generous toppings) it is a good value. We each tried a different topping style. Topping styles include Everything (mayo, lettuce, tomato, onion & dill pickle), Westside (mustard, chili, slaw and onion) and Ding-Dong Style (crunchy peanut butter, honey-cilantro slaw and hot sriracha sauce). I tried the Ding-Dong Style and loved it! Of course, having come from Thailand it was rather ironic that the waiter described it as their Thai style burger. We also shared some crab puppies as an appetizer - sweet crabmeat folded into large hush puppies and side orders of southern slaw, onion rings (more like straws) and fried squash. The sides didn't really stand out - the onion rings and squash were sliced too thin for my taste but maybe others like them this way. I preferred the cilantro-honey slaw on the burger to the southern style slaw. The only other negative is that the place is rather loud, although not as bad as some.

You really had to douse it in ketchup and ranch to give it the moisture/flavor it needed.  It was dry, light on the breading, and light on the crunch.  It also came with waffle-fries and those were of less seasoned and crunchy than the ones I've had at Carl's Jr.  I had the Falafel Wrap with Hummus for about $7.

When I was a kid, the building used to be an auto shop. My brother and I had our little fists ready whenever we drove by (remember punch bug, no punch back!).Second, Pinky's is kind of the successor to The (original) Penguin. The Penguin is a restaurant located not far away and is famous. No, really. I'm talking Food Network's Diners, Drive-Ins & Dives famous. The owner of Pinky's was a co-owner of the Penguin and a chef there. The Penguin changed hands in 2010 (not really sure exactly what happened, but loyal patrons of The Penguin were LIVID) and judging by the fact that Pinky's is ALWAYS packed, they all came along with the owner & some of their menu items.Despite the same ownership, the similarities end there. The Penguin was a hole in the wall burger joint. Pinky's is much more diverse. The menu includes fried pickles, hummus, some fabulous salads, a variety of burgers & hot dogs, tacos, corn dog shrimp (my absolute FAVORITE), and so on. Everything I've had there has been amazing, and this visit did not disappoint.I strayed from my usual (and absolute favorite corn dog shrimp) and had one of their specials. It was a spicy chicken burrito with Caesar dressing, tomatoes, crisp romaine lettuce & loads of Parmesan cheese. It came with a side of their delicious black beans and tortilla chips. I wasn't in the mood for chips, so I ordered a side of waffle fries as well.The wrap was delicious, but not as spicy as I would have liked. The chunks of chicken were huge & delicious. The dressing was delicious and the flavors came together well. This thing was HUGE though. I ate half at that moment and ate the other half for dinner and it was still just as good.Graham had one of the other specials, the flounder plate. He gave me one of his hush puppies, and a bite of his fish. Everything was so good! The fish was perfectly cooked, the hush puppies were crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. His portion was just as generous as mine and just as good.Pinky's is one of the places we stop at every time we make a trip home. The food is always good, and the service is always excellent. I LOVE that I see the exact same faces every time I'm there. Stop by and try a white trash burger, or a Spaugh burger (named after a nearby middle school) or their famous fried pickles, You absolutely will not regret it.",HT7T6OaKuJHU35j9u0LUDA,1,0.9488394260406494

Easily the best burger in Charlotte, one of my top-five burger joints across the East Coast, and just plain good, it has everything a fattie could live for.The best thing you can do is get the White Trash burger, which, Ive more than once, called the Redneck burger. .But try anything else. Falafel is great, the chicken variations (Ding Dong chicken, peanut butter and chicken? Say what!?) are brilliant, and the fried pickles, augh.

The last few times I came in a group, and we left because we didn't feel like waiting for a table where we could all sit together.  I came with a pretty good group from work, and as before we had to wait about 15 minutes to get a table. We ended up getting split into two groups, but whatever. We were sat at a table outside, which was perfect since it was a nice day.Disclaimer: since I am apparently the only person in Charlotte who never hung out at the Penguin, across from Thomas Street Tavern, I went in without any baggage of nostalgia for the old days. Once seated, service was prompt. Most of our table started by ordering beer. I have very specific taste in beer, and am not particularly drawn to craft brews, so I didn't really find anything for me. Ended up going with a coke. It was quite refreshing. I noticed that everything seemed fairly cheap. I ordered the white trash burger based on a recommendation from one of my friends. This was when I realized why the food seemed cheap: no sides are included. I took this as a sign and decided to skip the side today.The food arrived fairly quickly, I assumed. I didn't really pay attention, really, but it got there before I got annoyed, so it couldn't have been long. Looking at the burger I was relieved I didn't go with a side. It was pretty greasy. Soggy greasy, to be perfectly honest. Also, I thought the bun looked a little sad. Pretty much looked like a cheapo supermarket hamburger bun. It did turn out to taste pretty good, if not a bit undistinguished. I think all the ingredients kind of blended together, so nothing really stood out. It was generally good but not particularly good. I am sure I'll be back to Pinky's because it's close to work and has decent food.

Pinkys delivers taste in a big way in a cool and funky package.We decided to try them one Saturday evening.  About parking...dont even try to park in the small lot in front of the restaurant.  Head across the street to the larger lot available for Pinkys customers. The decor in this place is funky and cool.  Similar to Bad Daddys, Pinkys plays awesome music and has neat stuff all over the walls.Even at only 6pm, this place was in full swing.  We (luckily) got a small booth near the bar and proceeded to salivate over the menu, trying to pick the best options.Since we had heard so many good things about the crab pups, it was no question we had to try them as our appetizer.  For our entrees, my hubby got the mammoth burger - basically a double cheeseburger - with waffle fries on the side.  I got the pinky dog, topped with melty pimento cheese and chili, and homemade chips on the side.As everyone else has stated, the pups are the BOMB.  Crispy on the outside, with a soft, crabby puppy center.  Im not usually a fan of tartar sauce, but theirs is worth a try.While we were initially disappointed they only cook burgers well done, my hubbys burger was pretty darned good.  Juicy, plenty of cheese, and just the right amount of toppings.  Yum!  The waffle fries could have been cooked a tad longer for added crispiness, and they needed a little salt.My hot dog packed a punch.  It was so tasty!  And I honestly think their dogs are better than Bad Daddys, even though they are smaller.  The homemade chips were good, but I would have liked them a little crispier, too.  The ranch dip they serve with them is divine though!Service was really quick, even though they were slammed.  I liked that multiple servers assisted with our table, like they all pitch in to help each other filling drinks, clearing empty plates, etc.  Their prices are really reasonable, too.

The fried pickles are just as delicious as ever, crisp and the breading doesnt fall over everywhere. The burgers come in different sizes and combinations of toppings.

The parking lot was full: always a good sign! Not a whole lot of seating in the lobby if you have to wait long, but luckily they got us seated pretty quickly.Had to check out the pickle chips as I'm a fan, and they didn't disappoint. Good balance of seasoning and crispiness for the breading; although, we had to ask for the ranch dressing that's supposed to come with it. This did lead to some confusion because by this time we had seen three different servers, and I wasn't quite sure who to ask: the one who took our beverage, the one who brought it, or the one who took our food order, or the one who brought our appetizer. I see someone else commented on this, and I gather by connecting the dots that the restaurant does not have servers assigned to sections. This does make it a little confusing for the customer when you are trying to figure out who to ask for things or for that matter who you are tipping.The burgers were juicy and tasty, albeit they were lacking in the presentation. The food baskets they come in are so small that you really can't get a good look at them. Oh well, just pick them up and bite in! Ordered the White Trash and a Cheeseburger Ding Dong Style. Have to say I favored the latter. The White Trash was a little bland and really couldn't taste the sauce, but the flavor of the Ding Dong is banging: peanut butter and honey-cilantro slaw. Who would have thought!?! We ordered onion rings as a side, and I would certainly suggest to pass on those. They're not really onion rings, more like onion straws, and even that is a stretch. The breading was falling off of them, and they were difficult to pick up. There were very few rings in the basket, too. Wish they had a description on the menu because if I knew I was not ordering onion rings we certainly would have ordered something different.One last thing to be aware of...no kids menu. I realize it's not a family joint per se, but we weren't the only ones with kids in the joint.

I asked a bunch of friends where to eat locally, and whoever suggested Pinky's had the right idea. We usually don't go for big chains, etc. Plus, it was convenient to downtown and had a parking lot- plus very little wait. Score! I had the Nature Boy, which was a veggie burger. The burger was topped with cheese and roasted red peppers (interesting burger topping), and I got them to add spinach as well instead of iceberg lettuce. It was served on a sesame seed bun and pretty delicious- very large burger and filling, but I didn't leave overly stuffed. There is an entirely vegetarian and vegan menu, you may need to ask for it, but it's *huge*. Anyone from a vegan to a carnivore can find something to eat at Pinky's and enjoy it. Hubs had some wings and the white trash burger and seemed to enjoy it. Make sure to try the sirarcha ranch sauce- it's great. Also the prices here are incredibly cheap. It's really a steal, both of us ate for just over $20 and that almost never happens. The entrees do not come with sides but you can easily order and split some. My only gripe was that everything was disposable, not the best for the environment. I'm sort of a hippie, but I really wish I had my burger on a plate rather than in a disposable basket. The cups/bar glasses were the only non-disposable things. Pinky's decor is pretty amazing too- a fun VW bug outside and one on the roof, plus neat stickers and signs inside.

We are amateur burger connoisseurs, and we have heard great things about Pinky's, so, needless to say, we were pretty pumped for some Pinky's! We went on a Saturday night, so it was kind of busy. This does not bode well for customers because their parking lot holds approximately 8 cars (give or take a few). We lucked out and got a spot, but it was a hot mess when we were trying to leave! Next, the ambiance. The staff is very friendly, and the establishment itself is fun. It had that diner feel (I think it is a converted garage??), but while some diners can be antiquated and kind of dirty, this one was trendy and almost hipsterish. I am an avid hot-dog fan (trashy, I know), and the Pinky Dog looked MIGHTY yummy, but I was feeling a burger this evening. I ordered the White Trash Burger (burger patty with fried onion rings, fried pickles, and spicy ranch) because it is so highly regarded by fellow yelpers, and my husband got a mammoth burger Ding-Dong Style (includes crunchy peanut butter, honey-cilantro coleslaw, and Siracha hot sauce). We also split the Pimp Fries (waffle fries smothered with homemade pimento cheese and bacon). They looked like they had some really good cocktails, but we weren't there for drinks, so perhaps another time (and I will get that hot dog!).The verdict: it was OKAY. My burger itself was not very good and a little over cooked (we were not given a cook-to-order option). The fried pickles and onion rings were good (how can you go wrong with fried food?), but there could have definitely been a little more spicy ranch on it; I couldn't really taste it at all. My husband's burger was about the same. The burger itself did not impress, but the toppings were unique and pretty good. He also felt that they skimped a bit on the Siracha. The fries, however, were the star of the meal. Their homemade pimento cheese is pretty delicious. I could probably have just eaten that with a spoon and been satisfied (remember what I said about being trashy?).Thus, there are way better burgers in Charlotte, so I will not be going back for those, but there were some redeeming things that might have me paying them another visit in the future.",E4K3jDAxFp60IKWXmpPUEA,1,0.8120120763778687

We were lucky enough to find a spot on a busy night, but trying to get out was more difficult. There were a lot of people waiting, but having only two in our party, we sat immediately. (I wouldn't recommend for large groups on busy nights.) I got a burger Ding Dong Style and my wife got the White Trash Burger - we also split the Pimp Fries (pimento cheese, bacon waffle fries). The Ding Dong Burger had honey cole slaw, crunchy peanut butter, and siracha hot sauce. It was ok, I could have used a touch more hot sauce. The wife felt the same about hers. I like my burgers medium - we weren't asked and both came out well-done. The star was the fries. The pimento cheese is delicious.

They give you absolutely no room to grub. The food a lot of the time is messy. My husbands sandwich was falling apart and there was no room in the paper basket to catch all the filling. I got fish tacos and had to ask for an additional basket to eat out of. Plastic silverware. I cant believe it. I need a sturdy knife to cut my toddlers corn dog up and they bring me a plastic knife. Not even a well made plastic knife. And she has a little paper basket big enough to hold only a single corn dog. I asked for an additional plate to put her cut up corn dog on and they bring me a styrofoam mini plate that could fall to the floor if you blow on it. Last time I went I got a salad. They delivered it to me and asked if there was anything else I needed it. I asked for salad dressing and a fork! Geez,lPOtppK66ec_-w5aKeRbtg,0,0.11210885643959044

The service is great, because the servers will all help any table.  The atmosphere is fun - divey.  Even when there is a wait, Ive never waited more than 10-15 minutes. The VEGETARIAN CHILI is a bit sweet for my taste, so Im not a huge fan of eating a bowl of it, but its great on a hot dog, burger or fries.  Speaking of hot dogs and burgers, they have vegetarian versions of both, so you dont have to miss out on any of the fun burger combos or corn dogs.  Vegetarian corn dogs!  The breading on the CORN DOG is sweet and corn bread-ish, but lighter and fried.   I had the VEGGIE DOG with CHILI and PIMENTO CHEESE.  Everything about it worked for me.  The dog itself probably isnt that great, but smothered in chili and cheese, its delicious.  The FRIED PICKLES have a basic flour breading (which I prefer over cornmeal, but not as good as tempura batter).  They were crispy and served with a thick creamy ranch dipping sauce.  My sister enjoyed the SWEET POTATO FRIES.  Im never a fan, so Im not a good judge, but I found them to be sweet and limp, not at all what I want from a fry.  The DING DONG STYLE BURGER is weird but everyone at my table enjoyed it (to varying degrees).  The peanut butter flavor was a bit too strong, so we countered with loads of sriracha.  But the honey slaw on top was a nice touch.  NOT QUITE FRIED TURKEY SANDWICH is not at all fried, for those who are wondering.  Its a baked turkey that has been sliced and layered on a bun with bacon, fresh basil, tomato, mayo and cheese.  Husband found it to be an acceptable healthier alternative to what the rest of us ordered (minus the cheese and mayo).  The baked PIMENTO CHEESE WAFFLE FRIES with BACON = the piece de resistance for us.  They are careful to layer the pimento cheese inside the fries so its not just on top.  The bacon is perfectly crispy, and while this might have been the most decadent dish, its definitely the most delicious.  Add sriracha for more amazing-ness.  I did not get the bill, so I have no idea how much the BANANA PUDDING cost, but it was too much for 4 of us to split (so whatever the cost, probably worth it).  Its messy looking, slopped into a bowl with a couple of spoons stuck into the top, and its nothing gourmet or interesting.  But it nicely satisfied all of our sweet cravings at the end of a gluttonous meal.  Only come here if you dont care about fat or calories.  Its a cheat meal, for sure.",x37OyP--VEFE5p-xreplYA,0,0.9516159296035768

The pudding was great and had a very homemade cold pudding taste (made with whopped cream) served in a stryfoam bowl.Oh, I forgot to mention that all the plates, utensils or cups were either paper, stryfoam or plastic.

I checked out a tip from a fellow Yelper the other day and decided to swing by for lunch pick up since options are pretty scarce around my office... I was able to place a to-go order over the phone fairly easily without a long hold time at all... Upon arriving, I had to park across the street which I kind of expected...

I dont know if they tow, but who wants to find out?I arrived about 10 minutes after placing my order and my food was all ready to go... Definite plus... When youre working with limited time, not having to stand around waiting for food you called in is absolutely awesome... As usual, the servers were quick and very friendly... I ordered the Ding Dong Chicken Sandwich as tacos and it was amazing... I dont typically like crunchy peanut butter, but I barely even noticed those peanuts...  Between the honey-cilantro slaw and the yum yum sriracha, it had a great Thai-like flavor... I decided to be healthy and ordered the fried squash as well... The breading was light and crispy... A great crunch without completely taking over the flavor or overpowering the veggie... One of the most important parts for a to-go order is food temperature and Pinkys really held up in that aspect... By the time I got back to my office, the food was still piping hot and delish...

I know everyone and their mothers LOVE Pinkys, but honestly I never feel that excited to be here. One reason... service is always spotty. You may have a good experience once, but chances are dont hold your breath. I was here for lunch yesterday. I had to use the ladys room right away (thats what I got for drinking water like I should) and when the waiter stopped by I simply wasnt ready to order. I asked for a minute, and 15 minutes later the guy still hasnt stopped back by. Look, its lunch, and I was in my work attires, meaning I dont have all day. And I kept staring at the waiter hoping to get some eye contact. He never once looked around or looked up. Everytime I thought he was heading our way, he would get stopped by something or someone, and turned around without once paying attention to our table. Thats just annoying! I literally became that b!tch, and raised my arm waving like a maniac in hope to get some service. When he finally stopped by, instead of offering an apology, he told us that hes not the only one who could have helped us.  REALLY? Well, since you didnt inform us that your restaurant has an open table/grab whoever you like policy, I thought youre MY waiter! The only saving grace was the manager (Im assuming shes the manager) stopped by and offered an explanation (something got mixed up at another table, which caused every waitstaff to stop whatever theyre doing to un-mix the situation) and an apology. And she even offered up a banana pudding to go (which I gave to my coworkers because I dont really eat banana pudding - thus no comment can be made). 1 star for effort to make it right.Food: I never know what to eat here. Typically I go with the burger (southern style), but they are very greasy. And for $5 you get a single burger (with cheese) and no side... a little steep. Yesterday I branched out and ordered the Green Chile Pork sandwich ($6.75). It was different, and I liked it (too bad I had to wolf in down in record time, which caused some serious discomfort immediately after). The pork wasnt overcooked but could be more seasoned. I like the use of arugula instead of lettuce. And the pineapple is refreshing (can be grilled a little more).  Overall food was a solid 3 star. To sum it up: People who adore this place are still going to come here. For those who havent visited, visit once to decide for yourself. Im not the biggest fan, but its a-ok. P.S. Parking is still a pain. Now if you drive pass the place on the right theres an empty lot (instead of across the street which is now occupied by a new Dunkin Donuts)P.S.

I ordered the Southern 500 and she ordered The Stray Dog with the slaw on the side and cheddar cheese added. We also got an order of waffle fries and onion rings.Ok. They were SLAMMED. It was truly unbelievable. Totally understandable to expect slower service, but even still we were waiting for food until 4:36pm. To me, it seemed there was a shift change which perhaps contributed to the delay. The kitchen guys were busting their humps and the hard-working wait staff seemed unable to keep up completely. Not their fault, really, it just seems like they could have used several more hands.The food: My wife's soy dog was the most revolting hotdog either of us have ever tasted. I mean honestly. Barfaroni. Her slaw was forgotten and the cheddar they added was laughable. Not enough to justify asking.The waffle fries and onion rings are awesome. Waffle fries could come in a larger portion for cost, but the same cannot be said of the onion rings. Plenty of them and deliciously fried.My dog was awesome. Truly delicious from start to finish. The slaw is reminiscent of tartar sauce, which isn't necessarily a bad thing but definitely not what I expected.The place has an amazing ambience. Powered by a jukebox, we were treated to lots of Slayer, Jay-Z and The Cure to name a few. Oh, and Kiss pinball.

We expected it to be a bit busy, so we showed up 3 hrs before kickoff.  The short of it is that the food was really good, but we still missed kickoff, and both first series.  We were seated promptly, and drink orders were taken.  10 minutes later, our beers showed up.  Pinkys advertises 16 oz Miller Lite got $3.  I ordered this, and received a 12 oz.  When bringing this to the waitresses attention, she said thats not what I ordered, and walked away.We ordered appetizers, fried pickles and crab hushpuppies.  These were very good, but when we got to the bottom of the pickles, there was a pool of fryer grease in the bottom of the tray, thus making the last few inedible.  For the main course, I ordered the white trash burger and this was awesome.  My wife ordered some type of chicken sandwich with peanut butter and siracha sauces, and a basket of fries for us to split.  The sandwich didnt come with the siracha as stated, and we didnt get our fries until we asked for them several more times.  One of our friends didnt get his food until everyone else was done eating their meal.Overall everyone loved the food (5 Stars), but the service was absolutely horrible (Negative 5 Stars)!!!

Littered with bumper stickers on the ice cooler, kitchen door, and beverage cooler is home to an energy-filled staff dressed in Pinky's t-shirts but showing off their individual style south of the t-shirt.  The restaurant has posters and signs from local events covering every open space of wall real estate and the wooden furniture proves to be an inviting touch.  In here you can yell, laugh, and order filling portions of bar food designed to intrigue you enough so that you read every description on the menu (i.e White Trash burger, Pterodactyl burger, Camp Green House Salad). Because I love seafood, I went with the Corn Dog Shrimp.  Although I usually don't have any expectations, I was surprised when my meal choice did not work out.  As I waited for my order to come to the table, I observed many plates of food passing me on middle school plastic cafeteria trays (another cool and funky style of Pinky's).  The burgers were huge, smelled sinful, and the hot dogs, corn dogs, soups, and salads I saw made me want to eat everything that passed me.  I munched down on my Shrimp Corn Dogs and realized the combination was a bad mix. The sweet corn dog batter wrapped around shrimp did not work.  I did not know if the honey mustard worked best or the tarter sauce, so I used both.  I ended up removing the bread from the shrimp and eating them separately with the condiments (shrimp and tater sauce, bread and honey mustard).  Needless to say, it left a harsh after taste in my mouth and the potato salad was not my friend.  It has a gritty look to it and an herbal taste.  If you are looking for something with crunch (red onions or celery) and herbs, try the potato salad.  Will I eat here again?  Yes, but I have to try their burgers and leave the cute, unconventional food parings listed on the menu to the more daring crowd.

I did manage to get a fork and a knife however because I was stuck eating a burger without the bun it started eating through the little paper thing in the boat. Had to flag down another waiter (ours actually hasn't returned for a while) who when asked if everything was okay said she'd go get the manager.

I like mine with cheddar cheese and hot sirracha sauce with a side of honey cilantro slaw.The best appetizer is the crab puppies (sweet crab meat folded into golden hush puppies). Each time I walk into Pinkys I tell myself to try a different app but I always get the crab pups.Next time I visit I plan to try the Buffalo shrimp tacos. The young woman seated next to me got these and they looked good! She said if you like blue cheese this is for you.The staff is very attentive and friendly and the ambiance is unique and fun in a pulp fiction sort of way. Pinkys also has a full compliment of beers on tap and liquor. The only thing Im not fond of is the way the serve your food in these cheap looking paper boxes. Its not very appealing to the eyes. Parking is limited but there are designated spaces available across the street at Duncan D. This is a great place to take a date, friends, family or dine alone at the bar.",oXjBVy4JLQCkgtvCe3IdaA,0,0.9557464122772216

My boyfriend and I have been dying to come here so we already knew what we wanted to attack. What really surprised me here, were the prices!!

The pimento cheese really made this app, the chili though is not as flavorful as the Chili Mans vegan chili (hollaaa!) I couldnt get enough and they were huge...I was basically full before even ordering the entree. I got the corn dog jumbo shrimp while my bf ordered the white trash style chicken sandwich. I wish I would have replaced the fries my entree came with for something else like the black eyed pea salad..I cant believe Im saying this, but I was all fryed out...ME..fryed out. Pinkys accomplished that. The corn dog shrimp themselves were AMAZING..the corn dog batter was almost sweet and cooked to a perfect crunch. The shrimp was huge and juicy. The buckets also come with amazing and flavorful  dipping sauces, they are huge. I got the spicy ranch, nomz, creamy deliciousness. The coleslaw that came with the chicken sandwich was really good too, Im not a fan of coleslaw normally. Had minimal mayonnaise and I could feel the texture and taste the cabbage and other veggies.

(Hes sweet like that.) I looked through the menu online and had a tough time narrowing it down because so many things looked good or fairly interesting and unique. I ended up requesting the Kinda Fried Turkey Sandwich because I remember it being featured on the DD&D episode. Something about the turkey breast being enclosed in some wrapping and then deep-fried in oil... like poached, but in grease at a high heat. Needless to say, I was intrigued. I must say this sandwich did not disappoint! And I ate it after it had been brought home to sit in our fridge for several hours, keep in mind. It held up beautifully! Sturdy, tasty bun. The turkey really was wonderfully moist and flavorful. Slathered with some kind of garlic sauce with hearty basil leaves topped on. And provolone with a nice bite, toasted to perfection.

We preceded with the burger featured on diners drive ins and dives...forget the name but Asian pork burger with Asian sweet sauce and cole slaw. I gave it a 4/5 but my husband gave it 3/5. It had a unique flavor and definitely wasnt traditional. Fried pickles 5/5 yummy!!!!!! Pimpn fries with added bacon 4/5 I wish they had more cheese. As stated before service was great!

I've been here several times, and almost everything off of the menu I've tried has been fantastic. The appetizers are my favorite part! The pimp fries are perfectly cooked waffle fries topped with gobs of melty pimento cheese - amazing. The crab puppies are perfectly fried hushpuppies with just the right hint of crab. You also can't go wrong with the sweet potato chips and wasabi ranch dressing dipping sauce. After appetizers like this, it takes true dedication to power through to the entree portion of the meal! My favorite is the corn dog shrimp - jumbo shrimp deep fried in wads of delicious corn dog batter?! Genius. I've also enjoyed the salads before, which are fresh and flavorful. All of the food comes in paper baskets, which can make ordering a salad interesting, but no big deal. My boyfriend loves the burgers, although he prefers everything style rather than westside style (the chili/slaw topped option). I've also enjoyed the grilled Greek pita sandwich. And while I felt I had to try the Ding Dong Chicken sandwich (chicken breast topped with crunchy peanut butter, sriracha, and slaw), I felt it was worth trying once but not my thing. I have yet to try one of their hot dogs (and they offer veggie dogs too!). Their cocktail menu is also pretty extensive and appealing. I took my dad here and he loved the colorful Andy Warhol-ish paintings of celebs on the wall, as well as all of the Frankenstein memorabilia - we're big fans of classic horror movies.

After that, a procession of people who worked there kept walking down to our table, looking at us, and then walking away. Some would stop and take things from the table, but most just looked. They came so often I finally asked one of them what time they closed as I felt they must want us out of there (it was 1:30 in the afternoon, but I thought perhaps they only serve breakfast and lunch). She said they closed at 11:00 p.m. A guy, one of the looky-loos, asked if we were going to have anything else before I was even done with my burger. When we said no, he brought the check. Definitely felt like we were being rushed out of the place. I dont know why. There wasnt a wait and there were plenty of empty tables. The burger was o.k. I had the White Trash Burger.

I think that part of the reason for that is that there is no way to do it justice. This is probably my favorite burger spot in Charlotte. It used to be the Penguin, but that is no longer the case (a different story entirely). Pinky's serves up a great burger at a great price. It also has a funky/eclectic atmosphere that keeps things interesting. I've tried just about every combination of the burger here and they all have their merits. My normal go to is the White Trash Burger which comes with fried pickles, onion rings, and spicy ranch. Another good option is getting a burger ding dong style. This style consists of crunchy peanut butter, honey cilantro slaw and sriracha. I know this sounds odd, but this combination of flavors just works. I could go on and on about the burger, but I don't want to write a book here. The appetizers/sides are just as good as the burgers. I would highly recommend the fried pickles, which are lightly breaded dill pickles that come with ranch. They come out hot and their is a big pile of them for just a couple of dollars. I would also recommend the Pimpin' Fries which are waffle fries smothered in pimento cheese. You can also add chili which just makes them all the more delicious. I know all of these things sound greasy and they are, but they are delicious. If you are looking for a healthier option, I've heard from many that their veggie dogs are some of the best. The service at Pinky's is always friendly and efficient. I've never had too much of a problem with slow service, but they do tend to get very crowded. That being said, there is a good amount of seating, especially during the summer when the outside space can be utilized. Pinky's is a great price and they run some good specials throughout the week. One that comes to mind is their craft beer special on Tuesdays that offer all drafts for $2.50. They have a pretty good beer selection, and they always have some local Charlotte brews on tap. Parking is nearly impossible in their main lot, but there is overflow parking available across the street at the Dunkin' Donuts. Pinky's is a funky local place that is great for residents and a great place to bring visitors to the area. The food is delicious, interesting, and cheap. It is a great place to grab lunch or a beer after work. I highly recommend.",9vRqTspIAQGCkRBvMR9wXA,5,0.9632002711296082

It was not only recommended by Yelpers but a good friend who is a Charlotte native. Starting with the parking lot, the experience was frustrating at times. The lot is TINY and cramped and if you aren't a local and don't know all the good side streets, you can feel a little lost trying to park. The bright spot was walking in: there's a super fun photo booth that is a cheap and interesting way to pass some time while waiting for food. The eclectic beer list should please pretty much anyone. The service was a little lacking for me. I understand I came with a pretty straight-laced party with kids, but the young hipster that served us seemed pretty unnecessarily annoyed by having to serve us. He wasn't rude or slow, just seemed to have a permanent scowl and seemed above it all. I started looking around for signs that the restaurant's schtick was overly-bored staff. It was also SUPER loud...not a great atmosphere for a family meal or book club, or even people that want to hear themselves talk. Great for a party of loud rambunctious people, though.The food was really the disappointing part to me. After seeing the DDD episode I was excited for innovative food and tried the veggie burger. Um...there was SO MUCH GREASE that my bun was pretty much useless. Between the fried appetizer and veggie burger, I used so many napkins that I was probably the reason our server was annoyed. My parents seemed pretty lackluster about their burgers, too. I expect that from my dad, who hates restaurants, but my mom is usually pretty easy going and she didn't have much to say about her food. Or if she did, I couldn't hear it. My hubs liked whatever he got, I'm pretty sure it was a sandwich with a rare tuna steak. So there's a food bright spot.All in all, we don't visit Charlotte very often but there will definitely be other places I want to try rather than returning to Pinky's.",FzF5jJxhCaTdtY92imw3MQ,2,0.09495463967323303

Pinkys is a fun burger joint and its good for lunch. The atmosphere is relax and good to hang out with friends. I went with my friends and we started with the crab puppies for our appetizer. They were decent for how much they cost (13 of them for $5.50) My friend had the Mammoth, which came with 5 oz. patties plus cheese. You can choose any kind of cheese you want for a dollar a piece. The burger was pretty bland and bad. We were super disappointed. We were warned before they cook burger well done here, but never thought it would be so dry and no flavors at all like this. Everything they serve to you is on plastic or paper like other people said. Be aware of that.We were really disappointed at their service as well. The service was horrible and their staffs werent attentive at all. We came for lunch at 11.30 and got seated after 20 of waiting. Then, another 20-30 minutes of asking what would you like to drink.

It is one of the few areas on the Westside for us to enjoy a family meal while he is working. We arrived a little after Pinkys opened.  When we were greeted, we told the hostess that we had four in our group. She asked if everyone was here. I told her that my husband was on his way and would be arriving shortly. She said we would have to wait. I try to never use his job as an excuse or reason for anything. But as the place was filling up as it always does because it is a great restaurant; I let her know he was a police officer and was on a call and had limited time to eat. She again stated she couldnt seat us. I then said well then there are three of us and we were seated. We ordered our food and ordered for him so his food would be ready when he arrived. While waiting, our 10 year old noticed that there were several large tables being sat that only two or three in the party were preset.  I approached the hostess and asked her why this was. She got defensive and pointed to a sign stating the rule is the party isnt seated until everyone is preset. I asked why the large parties were different. She stated they were there when the restaurant opened. I let her know we were as well. When I asked her why she was dismissive to law enforcement, she ignored me and asked did I want to speak to a manager. I declined and let her know we would let the law enforcement and emergency services community be aware of this.

What an underappreciated piece of heaven on a stick. My favorite. We love the Craft beer roulet. They basically stick their hand in an ice bucket and for $3, you get whatever beer they pull out.

My first visit was with a group of coworkers after doing an Escape Room adventure.  There were five of us at noon so the wait was long.  But it was well worth it.  I had the grilled pita which was arguably the best peta Ive ever had.  Only minor complaint: I ordered fries and the waitress forgot but she later gave them to me to go and didnt charge. So Win Win!  My second visit was the next day because I forgot my credit card and had to go back to get it.  It was around noon again so very crowded but I got a seat at the bar and had the mammoth burger and fried squash.  The burger WAS mammoth and delicious.  Not greasy but very moist.  Excellent burger and I consider myself a burger aficionado so when I say its excellent were talking top 10 burger here.  But the best thing was the fried squash.    Each one was like a little piece of southern culinary heaven.  Golden fried and crisp with a slightly sweet salty taste.  And there were so many that try as I might (and believe me did) I could not finish them all.  If you have never been to Pinkys get yourself there.

We've had some rough experiences lately though...bringing a toddler out anywhere is super stressful at times and the wait staff can make or break it. The wait staff has been in transition lately and we had stopped going in lieu of a chain restaurant with an extensive kids menu and wait staff that liked our kid. When the little man first started eating solid foods, the wait staff gave their recommendations on how to order stuff to get the best deal on a smaller portion, because he's two and two year old's just don't eat all that much.But, then, that staff left and the newbies didn't know what we were talking about when we asked for a side of fried chicken or a kids burger. They'd let us wait just a little too long for food/drinks, or not bring little man's food in a timely manner (gotta expedite the kids meals), plus weren't friendly...it was too much and we stopped going.Decided to give our favorite place another try this last week and had a GREAT experience.

Trust me, its going to happen.During our weekend trip to Charlotte, we decided to try Pinkys after seeing all the pictures of the pimpin cheese fries on yelp. It also didnt hurt that this restaurant was featured on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives. We arrived around 12PM on a Saturday and didnt have to wait for a table. But the place was pretty full.All the food we had was really good. I was dying to try the pimpin fries and the crab puppies more than anything else. And since we knew those 2 appetizers were going to be a lot of food already, we opted to getting just one of the Pinkys dogs and sharing the 3 dishes between the 2 of us. We added the bacon to the pimpin fries and these were sooooo delicious. You get your moneys worth with the bacon and surprisingly, the waffle fries never got soggy despite the amount of cheese and bacon on them. The crab puppies were also amazing and came out really fresh. These will fill you up super fast though and we couldnt finish all of them. The Pinky Dog was good, but honestly I couldnt taste much of the pimento cheese since the chili overpowered it a bit. But it is still a really good dog! As for the service, they were amazing! We had a handful of different people serving us. They all made sure our water was refilled before it even got halfway empty. And the food also came out really fast.

Stay away from those chains!Pinky's was recommended to us by a nice guy who was working at the Manifest Records. So, yes, listen to the locals. Then, while looking through the local paper, Pinky's made the top 5 for best dinners in Charlotte! And yes, it made more than an appearance in Guy Fieri's Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives. So, we kept the best for the last and stopped at Pinky's on the way to the airport, hoping for the best.The outside decor, a cute VW bug on top of the building didn't disappoint. Same with the cool, funky decor. If you're into music, movies, comics, this place is a little paradise decor wise. You'll keep looking around while listening to their fun tunes they're playing. Not a boring minute in there.As you can imagine, this joint doesn't specialize in health food, although they have decent salads, wraps, a few Middle-Eastern dishes. Otherwise it's American diner food, with a Southern influence, pushed to it its limits.We started with a basked of fried pickles, my first ever, and they were good. Greasy with goodness.My husband tried their Korean Pork BBQ tacos and they were very tasty, with a nice slaw, the Tahini Salad was decent, fresh,  so was the White Trash burger (reading the menu in this place was a hoot).We got waffle fries for the table. I saw their burger of the month while checking their menu on line (in November they had a Greek burger), the photo made me drool and that's all I kept thinking about. We went there in December, during the X-mas holidays, so the burger of the month was different, but the Greek one turned into a personal obsession for me (I love burgers and Greek food, so this was a perfect heavenly combination in my book). I usually don't go divaesque on anyone, but since the servers were super nice, I asked about the Greek burger and they offered to ask the chef to make one for me, with pita bread instead of buns and they did, and they made this girl super happy. The Greek burger didn't disappoint, it came with fresh tomatoes, feta cheese, Kalamata olives. Opa! Thanks for indulging me! It melted in my mouth, full of goodness.What else can you drink with this type of food? We got a pitcher of local beer (the pitcher was our server's idea, it made it for a better deal, $15), tried the Lenny Boy de la Witt, a bit amber, I wish it was a bit stronger, but decent overall.And no, we didn't stop here. We went big, so we ordered the desserts, the biggest banana pudding we've ever seen and the Cheerwine pound cake, nice, moist and fun.Decent prices, good service, free parking to the right, once you pass the restaurant, cool, funky decor.Once again, you don't go to Pinky's for health food, you indulge, dive in, experience a cool, fun, local institution.",B3xvWa3K-4U42KK5WIN9TQ,2,0.9943089485168456

I immediately dug the atmosphere and the funky vibe.  Grabbed a seat at the bar in a small(er) booth built for two (sort of).  Booth could have used a bit more elbow room but I didn't get knocked into, so I guess it was alright.I wanted to grab a quick bite and head out, so instead of scouring the large menu, I opted for the Mammoth burger (two 5oz patties) with cheese and bacon (can never pass up bacon!) on a gluten-free bun (rejoice!).At first, I was second-guessing the 5oz patty size, but when you want more than 8oz and less than 16oz (standard big burger size nowadays), 10oz is a pretty good compromise.  I chucked on a size of sweet potato fries for good measure.Food came very quick, and I was off to the races.  Fries were tasty, with just the right amount of crisp vs bend. I enjoyed them with a touch of salt.  The burger looked stout thanks to the smaller and taller patties, but the crowning (no pun intended) glory was that bun.  I haven't ran into a non-plain, non-sucky gluten free bun yet - but this was interesting.  Poppy and sesame seed buns encased this burger, and I was very intrigued.The burger was cooked well with a good amount of season, but could have used a bit more pizzaz.  I guess with all the options, the plain burgers are plain.  The bun broke apart like a GF bun should so I definitely don't fault them for that - but it was tasty.I really thought Pinky's shined i the service department.  It felt as if I had the whole staff waiting on me, and was helped by no less than 5 or 6 of the waitstaff.  Great teamwork, and I never had to wait for anything (even though I didn't need much).   Price was very reasonable for the food offered.Would definitely return to again when in the CLT area.Only downside, seems as if the parking lot was a bit small, and there seemed to be some remodeling going on - not sure if that cut the spaces down or not, but hey, new improvements are awesome!",0IdfzFwxhtQd0Trs5DWWSw,1,0.8921648263931274

Dont be alarmed not to find a spot directly in front of the diner. Just at the end of the strip, youll find ample parking, a plus for any business near downtown. The inside was jammed for a Sunday lunch.For my lunch, I ordered the White Trash Burger, which includes provolone, fried pickles, and onion rings with a spicy ranch sauce and a side of onion rings (straws). For some reason, the burger that arrived had raw pickles and onions with mayonnaise. The burger was OK, a little over cooked for my taste, but served on a soft bun. Maybe if it would have been served as advertised on the menu, I would have been more impressed. The onion rings were good, but a little greasy.Dora here. Check out the popcorn chicken, little nuggets of breaded and fried white meat, served atop waffle fries with a side of slaw. Im a huge fan of chicken, fried or grilled, so when I saw this on the menu, I couldnt convince myself to go with something more adventuresome. Like Pimpn Fries (waffle fries topped with chili and melted pimento) or the Asian-inspired Ding Dong Chicken Sandwich, marinated chicken slathered with peanut butter, hot sauce and slaw. I probably shouldve worked up the courage because the chicken couldve used less time in the fryer; the outside was a bit dry and brittle. Awesome waffle fries, though, light on the seasoning and not too-potatoey as some tend to be.Still Dora. Pinkys tag-team friendly servers ensure that your cup never runs dry. And if the crowd hanging around outside on a Sunday afternoon and the awesome reviews are any indication, we mightve caught them on an off day.

Pinkys happens to be right down the street from my new house so we decided to give it a shot. Like how bad can something be if Guy Fieris into it , right? I pulled up to pinkys which is actually decorated pretty cool both inside and out. Was kinda bummed we got it to go as it seemed like a cool spot to grab a burger and a beer. Decor , fun environment , and seemed to be pretty good happy hour options is where a lot of my allocated stars are going. The food however left something to be desired. I ordered the garlic lime chicken tacos , and upon taking my first bite noticed I had in fact received buffalo shrimp tacos. Being the lazy host who picked the closest place to my house for pickup , I decided not to say anything. Im just going to eat these shrimp tacos , but I couldnt t. There was entirely too much buffalo sauce , the shrimp were undercooked very chewy , and cold inside. I thought it was in my best interest to throw them out. I  wasnt furious because I also ordered the crab hushpuppies , which were actually pretty solid , and I would recommend. One of my guest got the mammoth burger , which didnt have any of the condiments or  toppings he requested but he did say it was a pretty good burger.  He ordered a side onion rings to share , which were kind of like shoe string onion rings. I feel like they would have been pretty good if they werent so cold and soggy. One guest ordered the fish tacos , which he said tasted like captain ds. I have never been to Captain Ds so Im still uncertain if this was a good or bad thing , I didnt ask him to elaborate because I didnt wanna look like a nerd for never getting captain ds. We also got the corn dog shrimp to share , which were by far the best corn dog shrimp Ive ever had but also the only. I apologize for the monster previous paragraph , if anybodys still here I would recommend If youre getting it to go , I would at least checking your food before you leave. Lets face it , to go food is never as good as dine in food (excludes Chinese). I will probably give Pinkys another shot because its a mile from my house and some of the stuff was good , but I will be dining in.",OkVay4fc1uQt9Rgg4xApOg,0,0.15703341364860535

Really outstanding corn dog!  Im saying it twice because I would not have expected it to be so dang good based on corn dogs sampled at other restaurants.

I should have had a 2nd corn dog instead of the rings.  Burger was a single because of the addition of the corn dog.  The doubles and triples looked outstanding and I would expect just that much more delish-i-ness (?) by adding more patties and cheese.  Hats off to the cooks!

Im always on the lookout for these kinds of establishments due personal health issues so its great that they offer a variety here.   So Ive had the veggie burger twice before and the sauce the last time was a bit much for my taste but I also never eat spicy food at all. Other than that, I ate a perfect veggie burger with a gluten-free bun. As far as the bun goes, if you can live with eating gluten, eat a normal bun. If you have much experience with trying to find good gluten-free bread, youll know what I mean when I say these buns are udis shelf brand; aka dry as all get out. I will applaud the effort to make them less dry though because they put some butter (or something like that) and heated it up so its not too terrible.   I guess I shouldnt complain much about this but I ordered a house margarita and its pretty bad; it didnt have enough ice, it was really bitter (even more so than margaritas at a mexican restaurant), and I tried to put the salt around the rim in to make it better and that was a horrible idea, it got worse.Venue: 3/5- Small, good for groups of 1-4. Pretty cool, punk rock atmosphere. The only issue I have is that the seats arent super cozy to sit on and dont wear open-toed shoes; as soon as I tried to sit down I had a painful encounter with the metal, pointy table-stand.    *dress for the temperature outside as they dont have a ton of a/c (or heat for winter, if Im remembering correctly).Service: 5/5- I have never been unhappy when coming here.

I assumed there wasn't anything gluten free for me on the menu, and I got my burger fix elsewhere. Turns out, I was wrong, and they do, in fact, have GF buns for their burgers, despite no notation on the menu.Pinky's has always been good, but that new patio is bomb. A generous breeze blows through and the soundtrack -- as always -- is killer. I'll be a regular during warm-weather months to get the most out of that patio. I love the variety of non-alcoholic drinks for those of us who don't partake. The housemade sodas are crisp and refreshing. I also thoroughly enjoy the Sparkle Pony; a homemade Italian cream soda topped with whipped cream and a cherry. Go with the orange flavor; it's delightful.I've also been pleasantly surprised by the sandwiches on the menu. The Uptown Tuna Melt is better than decent; the ginger-wasabi mayo adds a fun kick. The Tony Baloney is low-brow food done exceptionally well when ordered Westside Style with chili and slaw. Go for the homemade potato chips with ranch as your side. Live it up.What we all really come here for, though, are the burgers. One item I've yet to see on menus elsewhere is a burger served Ding Dong Style -- that is, with crunchy peanut butter, sriracha, and slaw. Don't be a wimp -- it's wonderful. The only thing keeping me from giving Pinky's five stars is the service -- one server, in particular. She seems to be the food runner, as she's never taken my order but always seems to show up at our table each time I visit. I've had more than a few unpleasant exchanges with her, including when I alerted her that there wasn't peanut butter on my burger I'd ordered Ding Dong Style. It's in there, she quipped, as she pointed to a smaller-than-dime-sized glob on the inside of the bun, instead of offering to fix it. I understand it's a busy place, but every other server in the place is helpful and happy to be there. I hate to single out one person, but that's literally the only thing that's not wonderful about Pinky's.I'll be back, for sure.

We asked if the outside was shaded etc. she told us that they had a gorgeous patio with fans shade umbrellas etc. so we said outside would be fine. After 15 mins she took us to a patio with no fans, no shade and a bunch of smokers. We told her that would not work and she accommodated us elsewhere. (After another 15 minute wait.) The food was beyond subpar. It was downright nasty. I ordered their chicken sandwich. (Supposed to be one of their most popular with peanut butter, slaw, siracha and so on.) When I got my sandwich the grilled chicken was chewy and tasted like what you would get at the school cafeteria. My bun was most likely made by wonder bread. My fries were undercooked and soggy.

The location is a little tight but still comfortable for a small groups of no more than 5. Parking is limited in front of the restaurant.

We were not disappointed at all, theres very limited parking in the front so we had to park in the overflow lot just up the street. It was really loud and crowded but in a good way. The one major thing I liked is how cool the hostess, the waiters and waitresses are. Its funny because one server gave us the menu, another server took our order and a completely different server bought our food, whilst a different server refilled our drinks. The same with the cleanup, To me that just showed teamwork..Now the food, ordered the Crabmeat hushpuppies since they came highly recommended, those are by far the absolute best hushppies Ive eaten. Sweet, crunchy and golden with hints of crabmeat throughout each one. I really only wanted a simple burger with globs of onion (yeah I know), so thats what I opted for, with provolone cheese. Needless to say the burger was darn near perfect. They do have several different burger choices though. My son had the patty melt he says it was extremely good and for him to say that, it had to be good. Overall Id give this place a 10 and would recommend coming with your girls or a cute and wild lil date night for something different.

I figured how in the world I never heard of this place. It is a small free standing building, the inside looks just like any Greek-owned diner. Sat down and I found most lunch specials are $7.25-7.95. They have special of the day which was $5.99 BBQ plate with fries and slaw. Or $4.99 fried catfish sandwich. All of the sudden it doesn't look so bargain anymore. I went with country fried steak ($7.95) that came with 2 sides. I just wasn't feeling fried catfish or BBQ. I should have made myself feel like them however, because my dish was plain scary looking. I don't think any real gravy can be that white and thick. It wasn't even a hint of flavor besides an odd sourness to it. I wasn't expecting alot, i even expected processed steak, but I am shivering just to think I actually ate that. I am impressed by my courage and strong stomach. The entire dish was just... bad, rice was barely warm. I didn't want to make a big deal since I was with my coworkers and we needed to get back to work. My sides were a lot more natural looking, collard green and cabbage. I did get the complimentary soup, potato soup which in comparison to my lunch entree was a culinary masterpiece. My coworkers opted for the complimentary dessert which was peach cobbler. In my humble opinion fruit cocktail overed by 2 little pieces of arbitrary crusts isn't peach cobbler. By the way, I tasted the BBQ plate, it was a lot more edible than my steak.  Oh, they have the best iced tea in town allegedly. And the old southern lady waitress was all huney and sweetie at us. If that makes a difference for you.

My friends and I were starving and looking for something quick and cheap. And what do you know, a Dominos commercial came on....and it was a wrap.Now, Ive never really been a big fan of Dominos I didnt like the sauce, or crust and after a while I just kinda stopped trying and ordering. So, I wont lie initially I was not a happy camper. But when my friends suggested we skip the traditional red sauce and order white sauce I was a little more optimistic. We ordered the special two medium two topping pizzas for $5.99 each. The first pie had ham and feta cheese with white sauce and the second was their Philly cheese steak and banana peppers with of course their white sauce. Welp, heres my moment of shame. I actually liked both pizzas. Between the white sauce and the hint of garlic in their crust I found myself wanting to eat more and more. My favorite was the Philly cheese steak. It seemed like a weird combination at the time but it was actually really good...tasty flavors and those banana peppers just put it over the top. So for now, they get an A-OK in my book.

My expectations are pretty low to begin with, so to not even have my low expectations met is pretty pathetic. I received a flyer in the mail for a $7.99 3 topping large pizza plus free parmesan bites. Sounds pretty perfect, take out for $12 including delivery and tax! So I'm pretty excited about my crappy quality pizza to come, quoted about 20-30 minutes, no problem. And I'm waiting. And waiting.....and waiting. An hour goes by and I call them, they said it was walking out the door. I live about ten minutes from this location, and honestly should have just gone to pick it up myself. Because then I'm waiting again - another 30 minutes goes by and I call them and spoke to the same girl on the phone who said, They're leaving right now. and I said, Didn't they leave 30 minutes ago when I spoke to you? Awkward! I asked for a manager who was pretty apathetic (like I said, we're talking Dominos expectations here) and he said they were short 3 drivers - now I get that. I understand things happen but it's the lack of communication to begin with that hit a nerve. I cancelled my order and asked for a refund and he said it would take four days...great. So if you lost track here, that's 90 minutes, $12, and no pizza. The ultimate first world problem, I know, but if you're going to send out flyers and get people excited, make sure you can take care of the people you are luring in. I have ordered from this location several times before and have received incredibly mediocre service in the past, but this one I think is enough to keep me from coming back. I immediately ordered from Toppers down the road and received my pizza FIFTEEN MINUTES after ordering, yes forty minutes sooner than quoted when placing my order, and an hour and fifteen minutes sooner than Dominoes ever could have gotten here. Toppers is more expensive, but Dominos isn't worth the frustration if you ask me.",idRKaMMFDZw0aT2Dx3zfiw,0,0.07796308398246765

Thank god this next time I was only on hold for under a minute. ( I still don't understand how that happens after my first call) and proceed to tell the young lady on the phone how long I've been waiting on my order. She asks me what's the address and I tell her. She then tells me that there is no order for that address in their system. At this point I am beyond frustrated and ask her if there is anything she can do to compensate for the fact that someone has obviously made a mistake here and I know it wasn't me. She says that they can't do anything but put in another order and have it to me when if gets to me. I ask if they could get it to me soon because by this time it's going on 12:00 and she says that she can't put priority on it. Needless to say they need to step their game up for sure on the customer service and on the not losing people's orders end.

However, the last 2 times I ordered my pizza from this Domino's, I have been disappointed. The first time, it was a weekend (I think a Friday) so I wasn't surprised service was slow (apparently, my pizza had been made wrong the first time, but a phone call to let me know would have been nice). Last night, a Thursday night, is the reason for this one star review. Let me start off by saying, I am in the restaurant industry and have been for a good while, so I know that crap happens, but I also know that customer service is key. Here is a timeline: At 5:45pm I placed my order, and set the order time to be at 7pm-- I would get my pizza closer to 8. At about 7:30 I checked the tracker online and it said my order was quality checked at 6:40, so I thought maybe I misunderstood, and it would be out for delivery at 7. The tracker did not show it was out for delivery, so I assumed the order was either made wrong again, or they realized the time was wrong and would hopefully be making a fresh pizza. At 8pm, I called Domino's and asked for a status check and the young man said it wasn't out for delivery just yet. my thoughts: Crap, well ok, it was most likely remade.At 8:15, I checked and the tracker said Delivered. Great! I'll get my pizza soon.-- even though Domino's is only about 10 min from my house, I expected other deliveries needed to be made. At about 8:45 I called Domino's and hung up after being on hold for several minutes. at 9 pm I called back and asked to speak to a manager because I STILL had not received my 1, medium, thin crust pizza. The manager asked me to hold after I told him I hadn't even received a call (like I usually do) when the driver arrived downstairs--so I knew it wasn't out to be delivered, and came back. He came back to tell me the order WAS NEVER MADE. Really?? He then proceeded to ask me if I still wanted it, and that it would be about 45 minutes. I said Well y'all already charged my card for $18, of course I want it. I. am. Starving. Now even though I wanted it either comped, or a free dessert or anything to show good customer service, a respect for a very, very, very patient customer, and maybe even a little remorse, I held back on asking. I wanted to see if he would take initiative. He did not. Instead he asked me for my order and said he would expedite it, and it would be ready in 20 minutes. At 9:45 I received the driver's call and I told her I would be right down. I went downstairs and she wasn't at or around her car. I went back upstairs thinking maybe someone let her in so she tried to find the apartment. After some wandering around and 3 unanswered phone calls later, a neighbor said she had gone to the lobby and then went back outside. I finally found her, took my pizza, and went back to my apartment. As I told the manager on the phone, I understand things happen and computers mess up and things go wrong. I also understand that because I was a little too nice, I could have resolved the situation sooner. However, that is no excuse for the poor customer service and the obvious lack of structure and protocol. Domino's: I don't know if your computer tracking system is automated for our sheer enjoyment, but if it is, cut the crap. I check that system assuming at each checkpoint, a team member is actually pressing a button on a progress report. If you want me to call every 10 minutes, I can do that. Trust me. I rarely order pizza, so when I do and it gets messed up this badly, I remember. So I am not saying I will never order from you again, instead, I will make a point to order from you. And every time that online tracker shows progress, I will call and check, just to be sure. If that doesn't keep you on your toes, nothing will.

Even better, we were told the driver has 4 other orders that may be delivered before ours. Wth!Mind you its now midnight and we have to leave the hotel super early am to catch a flight.

Normally Dominoes has pretty good service but I would never consider ordering from this store again.I ordered salad and bone less wings around 11:40pm on a Thursday night and the estimate was 45 minutes. An hour and a half later my delivery guy finally shows up. Barely even says hi and hands me a receipt and asks me to sign it. He then proceeds to hand me the salad and box of wings. The box of wings of course is not even hot to the touch, that would be way too much to ask.I ask him for the silverware for my salad and he says oh yeah, I forgot that. I have to go back for your dressing because I forgot that too. At this point I didn't even realize what he was saying...I thought he meant he had went back already and that's why it took so long. I then get back into my hotel room and open the boxes up and realize I have dry cold wings without the sauce I ordered, and a salad with no silverware or dressing. Are you kidding me?At this point it is after 1am and this guy thinks he's going to go back to the store for dressing and come back? So now I get to sit here while my wings get even colder and wait for sauces?The worst part is that the delivery guy seems to think it was funny. He wasn't rude or anything like that, but he was like oh haha I'm all over the place tonight, I have to go back for half your food haha. But really, it's not even a tiny bit funny.I called the store and told the manager I wanted a full refund immediately. He didn't even ask any questions and just refunded my meal. You would think they'd at least want to know why their customers are unhappy, but seems like a regular thing there. Good thing they refunded my money but that doesn't change the fact that I stayed awake an hour and a half waiting for dinner and then finally got this gross cold product I couldn't even eat.

I was even more thrilled to find a coupon for a free omelette in my mailbox. So I decided to hike on over and take a taste. That was a mistake.I took a seat at the counter and perused the menu. Omelettes and eggs benedict occupied most of the menu, all at prices of $10 and over. All of the omelette options were unusual and I didnt see a make your own option. As I watched food come out of the kitchen, it seemed very disorganized. The staff dont appear to have any system under control just yet.I went with Stans #1 - an omelette with shrimp, crawfish, ham mushrooms and cheese. It was not something I would normally order, but for free, I was willing to give it a shot, as I liked all of the ingredients in forms other than omelettes. I asked them to make sure the eggs were cooked, as i hate runny eggs. When the dish arrived, it was bone dry. The crawfish tasted old and the shrimp was about the only edible part of the creation. Unlike the omelette, the english muffin that came with it was not crispy. The highlight of the meal were the seasoned country potatoes, which were salty but good. Had I been paying for the dish, I would have sent it back and gotten something else.When I got my bill, I was stunned to discover the charge for my unsweet tea was $2.69! Really?!

But I have eaten breakfast before, so I based my expectations on that.  If you are anticipating IHOP or Cracker Barrel portions, food or prices, this ain't your jam.  I don't think it was overpriced necessarily for the selection and options, but I do think it was overpriced for the quality and taste.  The young lady that seated me was very pleasant, and another woman that was walking around checking on people was nice as well.  My waiter was a little zzzz but competent, though my water was never refilled and once the food hit the table I didn't see him again.The food:The Traditional with corned beef hash ($9) - from their menu this is 2 eggs any style, an english muffin and seasoned potatoes.  My 2 eggs were indeed over-well but were nothing special and seemed small, the english muffin was somehow hard and chewy at the same time and tasted odd, and the only seasoning on the potatoes was salt.  The butter that I put on my english muffin tasted off.  The potatoes seemed to be the standard frozen style small cut potatoes, but were well done, though overly salty.  The corned beef hash was horrible - I love corned beef, like LOVE it, I'll even eat the canned corned beef hash on occasion when I need the salty beefy potatoey stuff, but this was not good - not at all.  The meat was pulverized, but grainy (?), and mixed in the mash was tiny cut green and red peppers, onions, and I was told potatoes as well, but I didn't taste that at all.  It was fried crispy like I like, but after two bites I wasn't going to punish myself anymore.  Yuck.Side of a sausage gravy biscuit ($3.49) - Relatively good, but I make better.  Biscuit held up well to the gravy, the 3 pieces of sausage were good.  Well seasoned.  The total (I had water to drink) was a little over $13 and absolutely not worth it.  The best part of the meal was the crushed ice in the water (I love crushed ice).

So, when we found out Skillets had closed and a new restaurant was coming in, we had high hopes that this place would be even better than Skillets. After my visit, I don't think that is going to be the case. On my visit, the food was properly prepared and nothing was outright bad, but it wasn't great either.  It was ok. However, I thought the menu options were meh and the prices were a bit higher than other comparable breakfast/brunch places in the area. I opted to go with the veggie omelet which included spinach, goat cheese, mushrooms, and diced tomatoes. (I think it was either 8.99 or 9.99) This comes with potatoes and an English muffin. The first couple of bites of my omelet were sort of bland because the ingredients were sort of clumped together instead of being spread throughout the omelet.  One thing that was disappointing is that it was sort of watery (?!) and I had to move my English muffin away from the omelet so it wouldn't get soggy... not good!  But as I got to the center of the omelet, I actually began to get some of the flavors from the goat cheese & veggies that improved the overall taste.  As the other reviewers have mentioned, the potatoes taste like bland frozen potatoes... definitely needs improvement! Also, the English muffin was meh as well. They should serve a better quality of English muffin.  Also, they don't leave the jams/jellies on the table, so you will have to request it.  On the plus side, our service was pretty good, I thought the portion size was ok, and we did not have a long wait to be seated.  Another plus is that they do not charge an upcharge if you want your omelet made from egg whites (many other places do charge extra for that).I would consider giving this place another try if I had a great coupon or some other incentive.

More than likely never to return to being good. This morning, as many Sunday mornings, I called in my order. Same as usual, Bacon, Egg & Cheese on toasted bread. The only thing I asked for in regards to the eggs, are Egg Whites. They can never get it right, So when I get  back home, I am sorely disappointed!!!!So today, I arrive 10 minutes AFTER (late) the girl said the order would be ready. Since I know how they roll over there with counter service. I land at the front counter, and as always there is no host behind the counter because the place is PACKED with people standing inside and outside.Usually my food is sitting there next to the computer, waiting for me. Not this time.I did overhear that they are short staffed and people are always calling out.OK, so now, there are workers all over the place and one guy comes behind the pick up counter to go to the  ordering computer/system. He looks at me and keeps it moving. Never once asking if I need anything. Never really recognizes that I am standing there looking stupid, for assistance, but he keeps it moving. The same with ALL the girls at the intake counter, right behind me. I mean if I am standing there looking like I need help, do they even offer any? NOPE!I contemplated to myself, if I should just walk out & leave and let them eat the  food themselves and waste my order. Since there was no service to me.So, after about 10 minutes of standing there looking stupid, I turn around and ask the girl (the same one that I have seen  all the time standing there, and she saw me looking stupid) if my order for pickup is ready. She asks my name. I mean come on!She goes to talk to a woman who brings two bags from the back out. It wasn't that she thought I ordered the pancakes w. Syrup...no. It's that the fool who ordered pancakes are going to get home and realize they are probably ICE COLD!!! Oh yeah, that person wasn't there either! He/She probably tipped them  about $10.00 extra for the great service. LMAO!Ok, so now on to the order itself. I mean it comes up to the same amount every time: $8.22. This time I opted NOT to give a tip on the receipt! And do you people notice that's the first thing they look at when you hand them back the signed receipt??? And I wonderfully walked out!Ok, for the past few months, it's been the same kind of service at this place. And it all seems to be ok, judging by the clientele that comes in, they have no problem with being overlooked! NOT me!So as usual when I get home and open the carton, the sandwich is warm. Decent.Now, let's look at THE CONTENTS...The sandwich is cut diagonally. However, I notice this doesn't have egg whites. Just regular yellow eggs.Usually the bacon is blackened to a crisp - literally burned. Not today. It's just overcooked and really crispy (almost burned) to the bite.Now as upset as I am, I'm not going to make a scene, since I am home..lol.I go to break apart the sandwich, but notice that the bread on both sides is positioned WRONG (upside down)! It's cut diagonally on the bottom ( top of bread facing right), but the top piece (top of bread facing left) , it's completely turned in the opposite direction. So, it doesn't match up. Which means they have stupid people working there!Now I am hungry.  I just paid $8.22 and I am going to eat it.I know a man made my food, because women are not disoriented like this. They are very precise and organized and orderly about things.And can I tell you out of every restaurant I went to in this Ballantyne/Piper Glen area where men prepared something, I have been disappointed EVERY TIME! The men that work in these places have no skills in the kitchen out here (most recently Applebees across from my apt on Piper Station Dr.).  AND I AM A MAN!I really need to return to cooking @ home. But I'm a single man who lives alone, with no nagging wife or spoiled kids. I expect the best when I order out.I can't do this with this place anymore..I'm done! I will gladly continue to go to my lil Light-rail  Diner on Sharon Lakes Rd and South Blvd! That place gets it RIGHT EVER YTIME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Never a disappointment!Maybe because the workers are EXPERIENCED and older. These young people are a lost cause!UGH!",4VJDYCLpFqjvH8bPjpFhgw,0,0.03795793652534485

This location is bit more spread out and the pace of the service is a bit slower but this would only be a problem if you were on a tight time budget.

Plenty of seating and the waiter kept my coffee cup full and checked in enough to be helpful and not annoying.  I had the Lobster & Brie omelet and it was cooked firm, the brie nicely melted and the lobster in chunks big enough to get good flavor.

Wasn't a fan that the waiter added more of a tip on my card then I gave him, by like $15. When I talked to the manager she asked if I had issues with the service because the tip I gave was low. First of all, it doesn't matter what the reason is why I left the tip I did, if you take more money then you allowed its call theft. Second, yes a matter of fact it was crappy service.",htzNwFdQGkvUEcbmBKSg4A,1,0.7875764966011047

The food and the waitress were both stellar.  The 20 year old host seating everyone had zero personality.  He stared with a blank look, jaw slightly dropped as I walked up, then waited for me to speak.  Definitely not the best greeter.  My omelet was perfect, the Hey Lucy I believe.  I did a substitution of the side and they charged me nothing extra.  The food was fast, hot, and had all the accompanying ( butter, salsa, etc) right there in good size containers.  It is not a cheap place.  $2.69 for coffee.  The waitress did keep it filled for me.  Overall, I will be back, but I don't see this as a regular morning stop.  They seem to cater to the breakfast meeting crowd or the 10:00am breakfast with a Bloody Mary crowd.",f8dRAxgqFnRH5l6AdbOf-A,0,0.19053104519844047

I wont be back for a third time.  As was consistent with my first experience, the service was poor including earning the attention of the server, the accuracy of our order, and the quality of the food.Once we were approached by a server she took our drink orders and returned with three out four drinks as correct.  Additionally, she provided my 6 year-old daughter a large, adult cup rather than one with a top.  Once our food arrived, my wife and I both noted ours was very cold (but was supposed to be hot).  My order was incorrect and when pointed out to the server, she returned with the wrong side item again yet charged me for the higher priced side item I didnt receive.Frankly, Im shocked they remain in business given what I expect is a consistent experience for other patrons.  I know with certainty that I will not visit this restaurant again.",qzsuqz2GYiM2p5zaOcNFUw,0,0.14662277698516846

Well it did not disappoint.  We enjoyed pancakes, eggs and turkey sausage and the city grits (Oooh!!! the bacon bits added a sumptuous flavor).  Best grits Ive had to date in Charlotte. Great hot coffee too. I love the bright decor.  Service was great as well with smiling attendants.  Im sure going on a Sat. or Sun. youd have a bit of a wait, but if you can stop in after the morning rush hour, its heavenly.

The eggs Benedict didnt have a proper hollandaise sauce - it was more of a cream. And dont get me started on the water they serve. It literally comes out of the kitchens sink and has strong notes of chlorine, fluoride, copper, and other minerals characteristic of bad tap water. I couldnt even mask the foul taste with a lemon. Owners, if youre reading this, please, were all begging you, invest a small amount of money in a water filter.
